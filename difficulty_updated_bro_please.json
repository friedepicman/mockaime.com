    "text": "A baseball league has $64$ people, each with a different $6$-digit binary number whose base-$10$ value ranges from $0$ to $63$. When any player bats, they do the following: for each pitch, they swing if their corresponding bit number is a $1$, otherwise, they decide to wait and let the ball pass. For example, the player with the number $11$ has binary number $001011$. For the first and second pitch, they wait; for the third, they swing, and so on. Pitchers follow a similar rule to decide whether to throw a splitter or a fastball, if the bit is $0$, they will throw a splitter, and if the bit is $1$, they will throw a fastball. If a batter swings at a fastball, then they will score a hit; if they swing on a splitter, they will miss and get a \u201cstrike.\u201d If a batter waits on a fastball, then they will also get a strike. If a batter waits on a splitter, then they get a \u201cball.\u201d If a batter gets $3$ strikes, then they are out; if a batter gets $4$ balls, then they automatically get a hit. For example, if player $11$ pitched against player $6$ (binary is $000110$), the batter would get a ball for the first pitch, a ball for the second pitch, a strike for the third pitch, a strike for the fourth pitch, and a hit for the fifth pitch; as a result, they will count that as a \u201chit.\u201d If player $11$ pitched against player $5$ (binary is $000101$), however, then the fifth pitch would be the batter\u2019s third strike, so the batter would be \u201cout.\u201d Each player in the league plays against every other player exactly twice; once as batter, and once as pitcher. They are then given a score equal to the number of outs they throw as a pitcher plus the number of hits they get as a batter. What is the highest score received?",

    "text": "Let triangle $ABC$ have side lengths $AB = 13$, $BC = 14$, $AC = 15$. Let $I$ be the incenter of $ABC$. The circle centered at $A$ of radius $AI$ intersects the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $H$ and $J$. Let $L$ be a point that lies on both the incircle of $ABC$ and line $HJ$. If the minimal possible value of $AL$ is $\\sqrt{n}$, where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, find $n$.",
    "solution": "The first thing to observe here is that $HJ$ is in fact tangent to the incircle of $ABC$ at $L$ To prove this we see that $A$ is the circumcenter of triangle $HIJ$ so by the incenter excenter lemma $I$ is the incenter of triangle $HJM$ In addition observe that by Euler's theorem that $d^2 = R^2 2rR$ so the inradius of $HJM$ equal to the inradius of $ABC$ \n \n Let $HJ$ intersect $AB$ at $N$ and $AC$ at $O$ The main observation is that triangle $AON$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ To prove this observe that by power of a point theorem $AN \\times NB = HN \\times NJ = AI^2 AN^2 \\implies AN(NB + AN) = AN \\times AB = AI^2$ Similarly $AO \\times AC = AI^2$ Hence $AN \\times AB = AO \\times AC \\implies \\frac{AN}{AC} = \\frac{AO}{AB}$ Thus by SAS similarity triangle $AON$ is similar to triangle $ABC$ Let the $A$ excenter of triangle $ABC$ be tangent to $BC$ at $U$ and the incircle of $ABC$ to be tangent at $BC$ at $R$ It is well known that $BR = UC = s b = 6$ Since the height from $A$ of the triangle is $12$ we have by the pythagorean theorem that \n $$12^2 + (14 6 5)^2 = AU^2 \\implies AU = \\sqrt{153} = 3\\sqrt{17}$$ In addition it is well known that the ratio of the in radius to the $A$ exradius is $\\frac{s a}{s} = \\frac{7}{21} = \\frac{1}{3}$ Hence $AL = \\frac{AU}{3} = \\sqrt{17}$ so the answer is $\\boxed{17}$",

    "text": "Bases Many of you may be familiar with the decimal (or base $10$) system. For example, when we say $2013_{10}$, we really mean $2\\cdot 10^3+0\\cdot 10^2+1\\cdot 10^1+3\\cdot 10^0$. Similarly, there is the binary (base $2$) system. For example, $11111011101_2 = 1 \\cdot 2^{10}+1 \\cdot 2^9+1 \\cdot 2^8+1 \\cdot 2^7+1 \\cdot 2^6+0 \\cdot 2^5+1 \\cdot 2^4+1 \\cdot 2^3+1 \\cdot 2^2+0 \\cdot 2^1+1 \\cdot 2^0 = 2013_{10}.$ In general, if we are given a string $(a_na_{n-1}... a_0)_b$ in base $b$ (the subscript $b$ means that we are in base $b$), then it is equal to $\\sum^n_{i=0} a_ib^i$. It turns out that for every positive integer $b > 1$, every positive integer $k$ has a unique base $b$ representation. That is, for every positive integer $k$, there exists a unique $n$ and digits $0 \\le a_0,..., a_n < b$ such that $(a_na_{n-1}... a_0)_b = k$. We can adapt this to bases $b < -1$. It actually turns out that if $b < -1$, every nonzero integer has a unique base b representation. That is, for every nonzero integer $k$, there exists a unique $n$ and digits $0 \\le a_0,..., a_n < |b|$ such that $(a_na_{n-1}... a_0)_b = k$. The next five problems involve base $-4$. Note: Unless otherwise stated, express your answers in base $10$. p6. Evaluate $1201201_{-4}$. p7. Express $-2013$ in base $-4$. p8. Let $b(n)$ be the number of digits in the base $-4$ representation of $n$. Evaluate $\\sum^{2013}_{i=1} b(i)$. p9. Let $N$ be the largest positive integer that can be expressed as a $2013$-digit base $-4$ number. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $210$? p10. Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that there exists an integer $b$ with $|b| \\ne 4$ such that the base $-4$ representation of $n$ is the same as the base $b$ representation of $n$.",

The winners advance to the second round, and the losers are eliminated. (b) In the second round, the remaining $32$ players are paired into $16$ groups. Again, the winner of each group proceeds to the next round, while the loser is eliminated. (c) Each round proceeds in a similar way, eliminating half of the remaining players. After the sixth round, only one player will not have been eliminated. That player is declared the champion.) In the game of rock-paper-scissors, two players each choose one of rock, paper, or scissors to play. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. If the players play the same thing, the match is considered a draw.",

    "solution": "We view this sequence backwards instead so Alice starts with a prime number and adds another prime number If this starting number is 2 then Alice must add a 2 because otherwise the number she gets wouldn't be a multiple of that prime she added (For example if she starts with 2 and adds 3 then she would get 5 but this isn't a multiple of 3 so that's impossible) If she starts with an odd prime number say 5 then her only option is to add a 5 since this is the only way that the second number in her sequence is a multiple of the prime she added However she would get $5+5=10$ whose smallest prime divisor is 2 so her sequence cannot start with an odd prime number Therefore the 2021st number in her sequence is $2+2\\cdot 2021=4044$ From here she can add another 2 which gives 4046 or she can add 3 which gives 4047 Thus the answer is $4046+4047=\\boxed{8093}$",

Assuming that the lights are both shown from exactly the top of their respective towers, what are the possibilities for the height of Alice's tower?",

He is curious to know what the optimal size of a rectangular sheet is so that it\u2019s expected to fit well in any given box. Let a and b be positive reals with $a \\le b$, and let $m$ and $n$ be independently and uniformly distributed random variables in the interval $(0, a)$. For the ordered $4$-tuple $(a, b, m, n)$, let $f(a, b, m, n)$ denote the ratio between the area of a sheet with dimension a\u00d7b and the area of the horizontal cross-section of the box with dimension $m \\times n$ after the sheet has been folded in halves along each dimension until it occupies the largest possible area that will still fit in the box (because Sean is picky, the sheet must be placed with sides parallel to the box\u2019s sides). Compute the smallest value of b/a that maximizes the expectation $f$. PS. You had better use hide for answers.",

    "solution": "complementary counting First of all note 1990 AIME problem 9 \n \n Anyways this is how I did that problem First off if there are All $1s$ then there can be no consecutive $0s$ That's $1$ way If there's $1$ $0$ then there are still no ways for there to be consecutive $0s$ That's $\\dbinom{10}{1} = 10$ ways If there are $2$ $0s$ then there are $\\dbinom{10}{2}$ ways to arrange all then numbers (choose $2$ spots to where you can place the $0s$ ) and then $9$ ways such that the $0$ s are next to each other (from $0$ $1s$ in front of them to $8$ $1s$ in front of them) $45 9 = 36$ ways in this case With $3$ $0s$ this problem gets way uglier We can't do what we did before that would take way too much time to count Instead we know that the $0s$ must be separated like so $01010$ \n \n There are now $5$ $1s$ left In this case we can use balls and urns We know that the number of $1s$ before the first $0$ added to the number of $1s$ in between the first $2$ $0s$ plus the number of $1s$ between the last $2$ $0s$ plus the number of ones after the last $0$ has to add up to $5$ (not counting the $1s$ already put in place ) \n \n So there are $5$ \"balls\" and $4$ \"urns\" Since some of these \"urns\" may contain $0$ $1s$ we have that the number of ways to have no consecutive $0s$ is $\\dbinom{8}{3} = 56$ \n \n Now we do the same for $4$ $0s \\rightarrow 0101010$ Now there are 3 $1s$ or \"balls\" left and $5$ \"urns\" (before the first $0$ in between $0s$ then after the last $0$ ) We obtain the binomial $\\dbinom{7}{4} = 35$ \n \n Finally we have the case where there are $5$ $0s$ Using the same technique (although not necessary) We have the sequence $010101010$ Now we have $6$ total places to place the final $1$ (again before the first $0$ in between 2 consecutive $0$ s and after the last $0$ ) \n \n So the total is $1+10+36+56+35+6 = 144$ ways to not have consecutive $0s$ (note that if there are more than $5 0s$ there must be at least one pair of consecutive $0s$ ) \n \n So the total probability is $\\frac{1024 144}{1024} = 1 \\frac{9}{64} = \\boxed{\\frac{55}{64}}$ \n \n EDIT woo 300th post \n \n EDIT Lol had to edit this post 3 times because it was my 300th post",

    "solution": "I will edit new solutions in if I find them S1 $A$ is the point $( 29 841)$ and $B$ is the point $(51 2601)$ The line connecting them is $y=22x+1479$ So the $y$ coordinate of $C$ is

of points on the boundary of $\\triangle{ABC}$ is then $21+3+19 3=40$ because we need to account for double counting The altitude from $C$ to $\\overline{AB}$ is $18$ so $[ABC]=\\frac{AB\\cdot

boundary of $\\triangle{ABC}$ is $161+40=201$ \n S4 Old concern about P4 I am not sure how this is possible I have this much Suppose $n$ has more than $1$ prime factor Let its smallest prime factors then be $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ It must be the case that $a_2=a$ and $a_3=b$ Then $ a^3\\equiv b^3 a^3\\equiv a_3^3 a_2^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}\\implies a\\equiv 0\\pmod{b}$ which contradicts $a$ being prime and distinct from $b$ Thus $n$ has only $1$ prime factor Let $p$ be this prime factor and let $e$ be such that $p^e=n$ We have $p^3(p^3 1)=(p^2)^3 p^3=a_3^3 a_2^3=n=p^e$ \n This means that $p^3 1$ is a power of $p$ which is impossible Solution $a_2$ must be the smallest prime factor of $n$ Suppose $a_3$ is a prime number Then $ a_2^3\\equiv {a_3}^3 {a_2}^3\\equiv n\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}\\implies a_2\\equiv 0\\pmod{a_3}$ which contradicts $a_2$ being prime and distinct from $a_3$ Then it must be the case that $a_3=a_2^2$ We have $n=a_3^3 a_2^3=(a_2^2)^3 a_2^3=a_2^3(a_2^3 1)=a_2^3(a_2 1)(a_2^2+a_2+1)$ If $a_2>2$ then $a_2 1>1$ and has a prime factor This prime factor must be less than $a_2$ But it is also a factor of $n$ which contradicts $a_2$ being the smallest prime

Let $P(n)$ denote the sum over all compositions of $n$ of the number of terms in the composition. For example, the compositions of $3$ are $3$, $1+2$, $2+1$, and $1+1+1$; the first has one term, the second and third have two each, and the last has $3$ terms, so $P(3) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8$.

Find the probability that the polynomial $x^5+ax+b$ has exactly one real root (ignoring multiplicity). p11. Let $b$ be a positive real number, and let $a_n$ be the sequence of real numbers defined by $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 1$, and $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} + ba_{n-3}$ for all $n > 3$.

Find the number of distinct ways in which $30^{(30^{30})}$ can be written in the form $a^{(b^c)}$, where $a, b$, and $c$ are integers greater than $1$. p14. Convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ has sidelengths $AB = 7$, $BC = 9$, $CD = 15$. A circle with center $I$ lies inside the quadrilateral, and is tangent to all four of its sides.

At the beginning of each game, one room card, one person card and one weapon card are randomly chosen and set aside as the solution to the mystery. The remaining cards are all gathered, shuffled, and dealt out to the four players. Note that two players get four cards and two get five cards. Players thus start out knowing only that the cards in their hand are not among the solution cards. Essentially, players then take turns guessing the solution to the mystery. A guess is a listing of a person, weapon and a room. Assume that the player who goes first in the game has only $4$ cards.

They have a warmup routine involving trading places in rounds. Each round involves three phases. In the first phase of each round, the owls in the odd positions rotate to the right while the owls in even positions do not move. For example, the first owl moves to the third owl\u2019s spot who is moving to the fifth owl\u2019s spot, etc. Note the $29$th owl will wrap around and move to the first owl\u2019s spot. The second phase occurs after the first is completed and in this phase the owls in positions which leave a remainder of 1 when divided by $3$ rotate to the right. All other owls stay fixed. For example, the owl in position $ 1$ would move to position $4$. In the last phase of each round only owls in positions that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by $ 5$ move.

    "text": "The 15 problems p1-15 come from Stanford Math Tournament. Rice Math Tournament had 13 same problems and p16, p17 as substitutes of problems p5 and p11. p1. Let $ABCD$ be a unit square. The point $E$ lies on $BC$ and $F$ lies on$ AD$. $\\vartriangle AEF$ is equilateral. $GHIJ$ is a square inscribed in $\\vartriangle AEF$ so that $\\overline{GH}$ is on $\\overline{EF}$. Compute the area of $GHIJ$. p2. Find all integers $x$ for which $|x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x - 6|$ is prime. p3. Let $A$ be the set of points $(a, b)$ with $2 < a < 6$, $-2 < b < 2$ such that the equation $$ax^4 + 2x^3 - 2(2b - a)x^2 + 2x + a = 0$$has at least one real root. Determine the area of $A$. p4. Three nonnegative reals $x, y, z$ satisfy $x + y + z = 12$ and $xy + yz + zx = 21$. Find the maximum of $xyz$. p5. Let $\\vartriangle ABC$ be equilateral. Two points $D$ and $E$ are on side $BC$ (with order $B, D, E, C$), and satisfy $\\angle DAE = 30^o$. If $BD = 2$ and $CE = 3$, what is $BC$? p6. Three numbers are chosen at random between $0$ and $2$. What is the probability that the difference between the greatest and least is less than $1/4$? p7. Tony the mouse starts in the top left corner of a $ 3\\times 3$ grid. After each second, he randomly moves to an adjacent square with equal probability. What is the probability he reaches the cheese in the bottom right corner before he reaches the mousetrap in the center? p8. Let $A = (0, 0)$, $B = (1, 0)$, and $C = (0, 1)$. Divide $AB$ into $n$ equal segments, and call the endpoints of these segments $A = B_0, B_1, B_2,..., B_n = B$. Similarly, divide $AC$ into $n$ equal segments with endpoints $A = C_0, C_1, C_2,..., C_n = C$. By connecting $B_i$ and $C_{n-i}$ for all $0 \\le i \\le n$, one gets a piecewise curve consisting of the uppermost line segments. Find the equation of the limit of this piecewise curve as $n$ goes to infinity. p9. Determine the maximum number of distinct regions into which $2011$ circles of arbitrary size can partition the plane. p10. For positive reals $x, y$, and $z$, compute the maximum possible value of $\\frac{xyz(x + y + z)}{(x + y)^2(y + z)^2}$. p11. Find the diameter of an icosahedron with side length $ 1$ (an icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with $20$ identical equilateral triangle faces, a picture is given below). p12. Find the boundary of the projection of the sphere $x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 1$ onto the plane $z = 0$ with respect to the point $P = (0, -1, 2)$. Express your answer in the form $f(x, y) = 0$, where $f(x, y)$ is a function of $x$ and $y$. p13. Compute the number of pairs of $2011$-tuples $(x_1, x_2,..., x_{2011})$ and $(y_1, y_2,..., y_{2011})$ such that $x_k =x^2_{k-1} - y^2_{k-1} - 2$ and $y_k = 2x_{k-1}y_{k-1}$ for $1 \\le k \\le 2010$, $x_1 = x^2_{2011} - y^2_{2011} - 2$, and $y_1 = 2x_{2011}y_{2011}$. p14. Compute $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{ln(x + 1)}{x^2 + 1}dx$. p15. Find the smallest $\\alpha > 0$ such that there exists $m > 0$ making the following equation hold for all positive integers $a, b \\ge 2$: $$\\left( \\frac{1}{gcd(a, b - 1)} +\\frac{1}{gcd(a- 1, b)} \\right)(a + b)^{\\alpha} \\ge m.$$ Rice Math Tournament problems (substitutes of problems p5, and p11). p16. If $f(x) = (x -1)^4(x - 2)^3(x - 3)^2$, find $f'''(1) + f''(2) + f'(3)$. p17. Find the unique polynomial $P(x)$ with coefficients taken from the set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and with least possible degree such that $P(2010) \\equiv 1$ (mod $3$), $P(2011) \\equiv 0$ (mod $3$), and $P(2012) \\equiv 0$ (mod $3$).

You are probably used to \"down\" and \"across,\" but this crossword has \"1,\" $e^{4\\pi i/3}$, and $e^{5\\pi i/3}$. You can think of these labels as complex numbers pointing in the direction to fill in the spaces. In other words \"1\" means \"across\", $e^{4\\pi i/3}$ means \"down and to the left,\" and $e^{5\\pi i/3}$ means \"down and to the right.\" To fill in the answer to, for example, $12$ across, start at the hexagon labeled $12$, and write the digits, proceeding to the right along the gray line.

(4 digits) I have a random number machine generator that is very good at generating integers between $1$ and $256$, inclusive, with equal probability. However, right now, I want to produce a random number between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, so I do the following: $\\bullet$ I use my machine to generate a number between $1$ and $256$. Call this $a$. $\\bullet$ I take a and divide it by $n$ to get remainder $r$. If $r \\ne 0$, then I record $r$ as the randomly generated number. If $r = 0$, then I record $n$ instead. Note that this process does not necessarily produce all numbers with equal probability, but that is okay. I apply this process twice to generate two numbers randomly between $1$ and $10$. Let $p$ be the probability that the two numbers are equal. What is $p \\cdot 2^{16}$? A 12. (5 digits) You and your friend play the following dangerous game. You two start off at some point $(x, y)$ on the plane, where $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers. When it is player $A$'s turn, A tells his opponent $B$ to move to another point on the plane. Then $A$ waits for a while. If $B$ is not eaten by a tiger, then $A$ moves to that point as well. From a point $(x, y)$ there are three places $A$ can tell $B$ to walk to: leftwards to $(x - 1, y)$, downwards to $(x, y-1)$, and simultaneously downwards and leftwards to $(x-1, y-1)$. However, you cannot move to a point with a negative coordinate. Now, what was this about being eaten by a tiger? There is a tiger at the origin, which will eat the first person that goes there! Needless to say, you lose if you are eaten. Consider all possible starting points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\le x \\le 346$ and $0 \\le y \\le 346$, and $x$ and $y$ are not both zero. Also suppose that you two play strategically, and you go first (i.e., by telling your friend where to go). For how many of the starting points do you win? Down and to the left $e^{4\\pi i/3}$ DL 2.

You remove a section of the bottom of the paper by cutting along the function $y = f(x)$, where $f$ satisfies $f(1) = f(-1) = 0$. (In other words, you keep the bottom two vertices.) You do this again with another sheet of paper. Then you roll both of them into identical cylinders, and you realize that you can attach them to form an $L$-shaped elbow tube.

(3 digits) Three cones have bases on the same plane, externally tangent to each other. The cones all face the same direction. Two of the cones have radii of $2$, and the other cone has a radius of $3$. The two cones with radii $2$ have height $4$, and the other cone has height $6$. Let $V$ be the volume of the tetrahedron with three of its vertices as the three vertices of the cones and the fourth vertex as the center of the base of the cone with height $6$. Find $V^2$. Down and to the right $e^{5\\pi i/3}$ DR 1. (2 digits) For some reason, people in math problems like to paint houses. Alice can paint a house in one hour. Bob can paint a house in six hours. If they work together, it takes them seven hours to paint a house. You might be thinking \"What? That's not right!\" but I did not make a mistake. When Alice and Bob work together, they get distracted very easily and simultaneously send text messages to each other. When they are texting, they are not getting any work done. When they are not texting, they are painting at their normal speeds (as if they were working alone). Carl, the owner of the house decides to check up on their work. He randomly picks a time during the seven hours. The probability that they are texting during that time can be written as $r/s$, where r and s are integers and $gcd \\,(r, s) = 1$. What is $r + s$? DR 4. (3 digits) Let $a_1 = 2 +\\sqrt2$ and $b_1 =\\sqrt2$, and for $n \\ge 1$, $a_{n+1} = |a_n - b_n|$ and $b_{n+1} = a_n + b_n$. The minimum value of $\\frac{a^2_n+a_nb_n-6b^2_n}{6b^2_n-a^2_n}$ can be written in the form $a\\sqrt{b} - c$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free. Concatenate $c, b, a$ (in that order!). DR 7. (3 digits) How many solutions are there to $a^{503} + b^{1006} = c^{2012}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $|a|$,$|b|$, $|c|$ are all less than $2012$?

You do not earn extra points for showing your work; the only points you get are for correctly filled-in squares. You get one point for each correctly filled-in square. You should read through the following rules carefully before starting. $\\bullet$ Your time limit for this round is $25$ minutes, in addition to the five minutes you get for reading the rules. So make use of your time wisely. The round is based more on speed than on perfect reasoning, so use your intuition well, and be fast. $\\bullet$ This is a Sudoku puzzle; all the squares should be filled in with the digits $1$ through $9$ so that every row and column contains each digit exactly once. In addition, each of the nine $3\\times 3$ boxes that compose the grid also contains each digit exactly once. Furthermore, this is a super-Sudoku puzzle; in addition to satisfying all these conditions, the four $3\\times 3$ boxes with red outlines also contain each of $1,..., 9$ exactly once. This last property is important to keep in mind \u2013 it may help you solve the puzzle faster. $\\bullet$ Just to restate the idea, you can use the digits $1$ through $9$, but not $0$. You may not use any other symbol, such as $\\pi$ or $e$ or $\\epsilon$. Each square gets exactly one digit. $\\bullet$ The grid is also a crossword puzzle; the usual rules apply. The shaded grey squares are the \u201cblack\u201d squares of an ordinary crossword puzzle. The white squares as well as the shaded yellow ones count as the \u201cwhite\u201d crossword squares. All squares, white or shaded, count as ordinary Sudoku squares. $\\bullet$ If you obtain the unique solution to the crossword puzzle, then this solution extends to a unique solution to the Sudoku puzzle. $\\bullet$ You may use a graphing calculator to help you solve the clues. The following hints and tips may prove useful while solving the puzzle. $\\bullet$ Use the super-Sudoku structure described in the first rule; use all the symmetries you have. Remember that we are not looking for proofs or methods, only for correctly filled-in squares. $\\bullet$ If you find yourself stuck on a specific clue, it is nothing to worry about. You can obtain the solution to that clue later on by solving other clues and figuring out certain digits of your desired solution. Just move on to the rest of the puzzle. $\\bullet$ As you progress through the puzzle, keep filling in all squares you have found on your solution sheet, including the shaded ones. Remember that for scoring, the shaded grey squares count the same as the white ones. Good luck! Across 1 Across. The following is a normal addition where each letter represents a (distinct) digit: $$GOT + TO + GO + TO = TOP$$This certainly does not have a unique solution. However, you discover suddenly that $G = 2$ and $P \\notin \\{4, 7\\}$. Then what is the numeric value of the expression $GOT \\times TO$? 3 Across. A strobogrammatic number which reads the same upside down, e.g. $619$. On the other hand, a triangular number is a number of the form $n(n + 1)/2$ for some $n \\in N$, e.g. $15$ (therefore, the $i^{th}$ triangular number $T_i$ is the sum of $1$ through $i$). Let $a$ be the third strobogrammatic prime number. Let $b$ be the smaller number of the smallest pair of triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers. What is the value of $ab$? 6 Across. A positive integer $m$ is said to be palindromic in base $\\ell$ if, when written in base $\\ell$, its digits are the same front-to-back and back-to-front. For $j, k \\in N$, let $\\mu (j, k)$ be the smallest base-$10$ integer that is palindromic in base $j$ as well as in base$ k$, and let $\\nu (j, k):= (j + k) \\cdot \\mu (j, k)$. Find the value of $\\nu (5, 9)$. 7 Across. Suppose you have the unique solution to this Sudoku puzzle. In that solution, let $X$ denote the sum of all digits in the shaded grey squares. Similarly, let $Y$ denote the sum of all numbers in the shaded yellow squares on the upper left block (i.e. the $3 \\times 3$ box outlined red towards the top left). Concatenate $X$ with $Y$ in that order, and write that down. 8 Across. For any $n \\in N$ such that $1 < n < 10$, define the sequence $X_{n,1}$,$X_{n,2}$,$...$ by $X_{n,1} = n$, and for $r \\ge 2$, X_{n,r} is smallest number $k \\in N$ larger than X_{n,r-1} such that $k$ and the sum of digits of $k$ are both powers of $n$. For instance, $X_{3,1 = 3}$, $X_{3,2} = 9$, $X_{3,3} = 27$, and so on. Concatenate $X_{2,2}$ with $X_{2,4}$, and write down the answer. 9 Across. Find positive integers $x, y,z$ satisfying the following properties: $y$ is obtained by subtracting $93$ from $x$, and $z$ is obtained by subtracting $183$ from $y$, furthermore, $x, y$ and $z$ in their base-$10$ representations contain precisely all the digits from $1$ through $9$ once (i.e. concatenating $x, y$ and $z$ yields a valid $9$-digit Sudoku answer). Obviously, write down the concatenation of $x, y$ and $z$ in that order. 11 Across. Find the largest pair of two-digit consecutive prime numbers $a$ and $b$ (with $a < b$) such that the sum of the digits of a plus the sum of the digits of b is also a prime number. Write the concatenation of $a$ and $b$. 12 Across. Suppose you have a strip of $2n + 1$ squares, with n frogs on the $n$ squares on the left, and $n$ toads on the $n$ squares on the right. A move consists either of a toad or a frog sliding to an adjacent square if it is vacant, or of a toad or a frog jumping one square over another one and landing on the next square if it is vacant. For instance, the starting position has the position or the position as results of valid first moves. What is the minimum number of moves needed to swap the toads with the frogs if $n = 5$? How about $n = 6$? Concatenate your answers. 15 Across. Let $w$ be the largest number such that $w$, $2w$ and $3w$ together contain every digit from $1$ through $9$ exactly once. Let $x$ be the smallest integer with the property that its first $5$ multiples contain the digit $9$. A Leyland number is an integer of the form $m^n + n^m$ for integers $m, n > 1$. Let $y$ be the fourth Leyland number. A Pillai prime is a prime number $p$ for which there is an integer $n > 0$ such that $n! \\equiv - 1 (mod \\,\\, p)$, but $p \\not\\equiv 1 (mod \\,\\, n)$. Let $z$ be the fourth Pillai prime. Concatenate $w$, $x, y$ and $z$ in that order to obtain a permutation of $1,..., 9$. Write down this permutation. 19 Across. A hoax number $k \\in N$ is one for which the sum of its digits (in base $10$) equals the sum of the digits of its distinct prime factors (in base $10$). For instance, the distinct prime factors of $22$ are $2$ and $11$, and we have $2+2 = 2+(1+1)$. In fact, $22$ is the first hoax number. What is the second? 20 Across. Let $a, b$ and $c$ be distinct $2$-digit numbers satisfying the following properties: \u2013 $a$ is the largest integer expressible as $a = x^y = y^x$, for distinct integers $x$ and $y$. \u2013 $b$ is the smallest integer which has three partitions into three parts, which all give the same product (which turns out to be $1200$) when multiplied. \u2013 $c$ is the largest number that is the sum of the digits of its cube. Concatenate $a, b$ and $c$, and write down the resulting 6-digit prime number. 21 Across. Suppose $N = \\underline{a}\\, \\underline{b} \\, \\underline{c} \\, \\underline{d}$ is a $4$-digit number with digits $a, b, c$ and $d$, such that $N = a \\cdot b \\cdot c \\cdot d^7$. Find $N$. 22 Across. What is the smallest number expressible as the sum of $2, 3, 4$, or $5$ distinct primes? Down 1 Down. For some $a, b, c \\in N$, let the polynomial $$p(x) = x^5 - 252x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + cx - 62604360$$have five distinct roots that are positive integers. Four of these are 2-digit numbers, while the last one is single-digit. Concatenate all five roots in decreasing order, and write down the result. 2 Down. Gene, Ashwath and Cosmin together have $2511$ math books. Gene now buys as many math books as he already has, and Cosmin sells off half his math books. This leaves them with $2919$ books in total. After this, Ashwath suddenly sells off all his books to buy a private jet, leaving Gene and Cosmin with a total of $2184$ books. How many books did Gene, Ashwath and Cosmin have to begin with? Concatenate the three answers (in the order Gene, Ashwath, Cosmin) and write down the result. 3 Down. A regular octahedron is a convex polyhedron composed of eight congruent faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle; four of them meet at each vertex. For instance, the following diagram depicts a regular octahedron: Let $T$ be a regular octahedron of edge length $28$. What is the total surface area of $T$, rounded to the nearest integer? 4 Down. Evaluate the value of the expression $$\\sum^{T_{25}}_{k=T_{24}+1}k, $$where $T_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ triangular number (the sum of the integers from $1$ through $i$). 5 Down. Suppose $r$ and $s$ are consecutive multiples of$ 9$ satisfying the following properties: \u2013 $r$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written as the sum of $3$ positive squares in $3$ different ways. \u2013 $s$ is the smallest $2$-digit number that is a Woodall number as well as a base-$10$ Harshad number. A Woodall number is any number of the form $n \\cdot 2^n - 1$ for some $n \\in N$. A base-$10$ Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits in base $10$. Concatenate $r$ and $s$ and write down the result. 10 Down. For any $k \\in N$, let $\\phi_p(k)$ denote the sum of the distinct prime factors of $k$. Suppose $N$ is the largest integer less than $50000$ satisfying $\\phi_p(N) =\\phi_p(N + 1)$, where the common value turns out to be a meager $55$. What is$ N$? 13 Down. The $n^{th}$ $s$-gonal number $P(s, n)$ is defined as $$P(s, n) = (s - 3)T_{n-1} + T_n$$where $T_i$ is the $i^{th}$ triangular number (recall that the $i^{th}$ triangular number is the sum of the numbers $1$ through $i$). Find the least $N$ such that $N$ is both a $34$-gonal number, and a $163$-gonal number. 14 Down. A biprime is a positive integer that is the product of precisely two (not necessarily distinct) primes. A cluster of biprimes is an ordered triple $(m,m + 1,m + 2)$ of consecutive integers that are biprimes. There are precisely three clusters of biprimes below 100. Denote these by, say, $$\\{(p, p + 1, p + 2), (q, q + 1,q + 2), (r, r + 1, r + 2)\\}$$and add the condition that $p + 2 < q < r - 2$ to fix the three clusters. Interestingly, $p + 1$ and $q$ are both multiples of $17$. Concatenate $q$ with $p + 1$ in that order, and write down the result. 16 Down. Find the least positive integer $m$ (written in base $10$ as $m = \\underline{a} \\, \\underline{b} \\, \\underline{c} $, with digits $a, b,c$), such that $m = (b + c)^a$. 17 Down. Let $X$ be a set containing $32$ elements, and let $Y\\subseteq X$ be a subset containing $29$ elements. How many $2$-element subsets of $X$ are there which have nonempty intersection with $Y$? 18 Down. Find a positive integer $K < 196$, which is a strange twin of the number $196$, in the sense that $K^2$ shares the same digits as $196^2$, and $K^3$ shares the same digits as $196^3$. PS.

    "solution": "ok i really hate bill why is k<2015 even necessary \n \n Solution So note that $73|f(k)$ iff 73 divides the sum of the elements of $\\mathbb{F}_{73}$ with order $\\frac{72}{\\gcd(k 72)}$ This is because when you raise primitive to the $k$ t h power the set of outputs is the set of elements with order $\\frac{72}{\\gcd(k 72)}$ and the outputs evenly space themselves Furthermore there are $\\varphi(d)$ numbers $k$ so that $g^k$ has order $d$ The sum of the numbers with order $d$ is the same as the sum of the $d$ th primitive roots of unity so it is $\\mu(d)$ \n \n So we want to sum $\\varphi(d)$ over all divisors of $d$ with $\\mu(d)=0$ since otherwise it is 1 or 1 which is not divisible by 73 This is all divisors of 72 except the squarefree ones which are 1 2 3 6 Thus there are $72 \\varphi(1) \\varphi(2) \\varphi(3) \\varphi(6)=66$ numbers Except the question asks for k<2015 so we have to do $66\\cdot\\frac{2016}{72} 1=1847$ since 2016 doesn't work but 2015 works So this was a cool problem except bill decided to make it k<2015 so </3",

Now, another unit circle $S$ is placed inside the polygon such that it is externally tangent to two adjacent circles centered at the vertices. This circle $S$ is allowed to roll freely in the interior of the polygon as long as it remains externally tangent to the vertex circles. As it rolls, $S$ turns the color of any point it touches into black. After it rolls completely around the interior of the polygon, the total length of the black lengths can be expressed in the form $\\tfrac{p\\pi}{q}$ for positive integers $p, q$ satisfying $\\gcd(p, q) = 1$.

The cows are initially lined up in order $1, 2,..., 2009$ on the negative $x$ axis. Conway can give two possible commands to the cows. One is the PUSH command, upon which the first cow from the negative $x$ axis moves to the lowest position on the positive $y$ axis. The other is the POP command, upon which the cow in the lowest position on the $y$ axis moves to the positive $x$ axis. For example, if Conway says PUSH POP $2009$ times, then the resulting permutation of cows is the same, $1, 2,..., 2009$. If Conway says PUSH $2009$ times followed by POP $2009$ times, the resulting permutation of cows is $2009,..., 2, 1$. How many output permutations are possible after Conway finishes moving all the cows from the negative $x$ axis to the positive $x$ axis?",

So he puts one diamond aside, splits the remaining ones in to seven equal piles, and takes his pile along with the extra diamond. Then, he runs off with the diamonds.

    "solution": "Solution Let $f(x) = (|x 1| + |x + 1|)$ (by the problem $f$ only takes integer inputs) Note that $f(0) = 2$ and $f(y_n) = 2|y_n|$ for some $y_n \\ne 0$ We want to compute the minimum value of $\\sum_{n=1}^{24} f(y_n)$ Given the restriction of the problem we have that $y_{2k 1} + y_{2k} = 20$ If any of the $y_i$ are negative we're essentially unnecessarily adding to our sum since our function $f$ only cares about absolute values We'd also have to increase the other $y_j$ that's paired with $y_i$ So we want as many positive pairs of $y_{2k 1}$ $y_{2k}$ as possible For example we can take $(y_{2k 1} y_{2k}) = (1 19) (2 18) \\dots (9 11)$ Then we'll take $(0 20) ( 1 21) ( 2 22)$ for the other three pairs (since $y_i$ must be distinct) Our answer then is $9\\cdot 40 + 42 + 44 + 48 = \\boxed{494}$",

    "solution": "Solution First we can verify by inspection that $(x n) = (3 5) (4 7)$ are solutions Now factorize the RHS to get $3 \\times 2^{x} = (n+1)(n 1)$ Suppose that $n+1 = 3 \\cdot 2^{i}$ and $n 1 = 2^{j}$ with $i+j = x$ Then $2 = 3 \\cdot 2^{i} 2^j$ and clearly $i<j$ so $2 = 2^{i}(3 2^{j i})$ Thus $2^{i} = 1$ or $2$ so $i = 0 1$ If $i = 0$ then $3 2^{j} = 2$ so $j = 0$ But this is impossible because than $x$ is not positive Else we have $i = 1$ which makes $j = 2$ which produces the solution $x= 3$ \n \n Now suppose that $n+1 = 2^{i}$ and $n 1 = 3 \\cdot 2^{j}$ We clearly have $j<i$ so subtracting the equations and factoring yields $2 = 2^{j}(2^{i j} 3)$ Thus $j = 0 1$ and in a similar manner we get the only solution to be $x=4$ Therefore the only possible values for $x$ are $3$ and $4$ hence the answer is $3+4 = \\boxed{7}$",

Joe continues this process until every side of every unit cube is painted. After how many times of doing this is the expected number of painted faces closest to half of the total?",
    "solution": "Let $U_n$ be the expected number of unpainted faces after $n$ dips and let $P_n$ be the expected number of painted ones Of course \\[U_n + P_n = 1729(6)\\] Half the time we recombine the unit cubes into cubes of side lengths $1$ and $12$ In this case the total number of painted faces will be $6(1^2) + 6(12^2) = 870$ Then the number of unpainted cubes we expect to paint is $\\frac{870}{6(1729)}U_n$ \n \n If we recombine the unit cubes into cubes of side $9$ and $10$ there are $6(9^2 + 10^2) = 1086$ faces that are painted so the number of unpainted cubes we expect to paint is $\\frac{1086}{6(1729)}U_n$ Averaging these two we get $\\frac{163}{1729}U_n$ expected painted cubes Then in general \\[P_n = P_{n 1} + \\frac{163}{1729}U_{n 1} = P_{n 1} + \\frac{163}{1729}(1729(6) P_n) = \\] \\[\\frac{1566}{1729}P_{n 1} + 978\\] Keeping in mind that $3(1729) = 5187$ we can crank through the first few terms to find that $\\boxed{n = 7}$ will give almost exactly half the possible faces (although I had to resort to Mathematica for the computation I don't know how one would actually do this on the contest)",

    "solution": "This problem involves both combinatorics and number theory I'll start the discussion with the combinatorics part Call a ternary string a $k$ repeater if its first (leftmost) $k$ digit substring equals its last (rightmost) $k$ digit substring For a ternary string $d$ let $f(d)$ denote the smallest positive integer $k$ for which $d$ is a $k$ repeater Call $d$ primitive if $f(d)$ is the length of $d$ \n \n Let $n$ be the length of the string $d = d_1d_2\\ldots d_n$ We first show that if $d$ is not primitive then $f(d)$ is necessarily at most $n/2$ By way of contradiction if $2f(d) > n$ then the leftmost and rightmost substrings of $d$ of length $f(d)$ must overlap in the middle Specifically if we let $s$ be the substring $d_1\\ldots d_{f(d)}$ and $t$ be the substring $d_{n f(d)+1}\\ldots d_n$ then $s$ must equal $t$ so for each $i \\in \\{n f(d) + 1 \\ldots f(d)\\}$ we have $s_i = d_i = t_{i (n f(d))} = s_{i (n f(d))}$ Therefore the first $2f(d) n$ digits of $s$ must match the last $2f(d) n$ digits of $s$ so the first $2f(d) n$ digits of $d$ must match the last $2f(d) n$ digits of $d$ Because $d$ is not primitive $f(d) < n$ so $2f(d) n = f(d) + (f(d) n) < f(d)$ so $d$ is a $k$ repeater for $k$ equal to $2f(d) n$ which is less than $f(d)$ this contradicts the definition of $f(d)$ \n \n For any $n$ and $k$ with $1 \\leq k \\leq \\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ any $n$ digit string $d$ with $f(d) = k$ can be uniquely generated by picking a unique primitive $k$ digit string $s$ picking a unique $(n 2k)$ digit string $t$ and setting $d = sts$ The number of ways to choose $s$ is $a_k$ and the number of ways to choose $t$ is $3^{n 2k}$ Thus there are $3^{n 2k}a_k$ strings $d$ with $n$ digits with $f(d) = k$ There are $3^n$ total strings $d$ with $n$ digits so the number of primitive $n$ digit strings is \n $$a_n = 3^n \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} 3^{n 2k}a_k $$ Some easy base cases are $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 3$ We can eliminate the summation from this recurrence relation in several ways Here are a few For $n \\geq 2$ observe that \n $$a_{n 2} = 3^{n 2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor 1} 3^{n 2 2k}a_k = \\frac{1}{9}\\left(3^n \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor 1} 3^{n 2k}a_k\\right) = \\frac{a_n + 3^{n 2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} a_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}}{9} $$ so $a_n = 9a_{n 2} 3^{n 2\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} a_{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor}$ In other words when $n$ is even $a_n = 9a_{n 2} a_{n/2}$ and when $n$ is odd $a_n = 9a_{n 2} 3a_{(n 1)/2}$ Also for odd $n$ $\\lfloor(n 1)/2\\rfloor$ equals $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$ so \n $$a_{n 1} = 3^{n 1} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor} 3^{n 1 2k}a_k = \\frac{a_n}{3} \\implies a_n = 3a_{n 1} $$ \n The remainder of the problem is number theory Or maybe someone else can find an explicit formula or a more insightful recurrence relation for $a_n$",

Furthermore, we assume that the $1011$ numbers on both sides are written in some order. After Bob does this, Anna has the opportunity to swap the positions of the two numbers lying on different sides of the paper if they have different parity. Anna wins if, after finitely many moves, all odd numbers end up on the left, in increasing order, and all even ones end up on the right, in increasing order. Can Bob write down a arrangement of numbers for which Anna cannot win? For example, Bob could write down numbers in the following way: $$4, 2, 5, 7, 9,..., 2021\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\, \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,,\\, 3, 1, 6, 8, 10,..., 2022$$Then Anna could swap the numbers $1, 4$ and then swap $2, 3$ to win. However, if Anna swapped the pairs $3, 4$ and $1, 2$, the resulting numbers on the left and on the right would not be in increasing order, and hence Anna would not win.",
    "solution": "Bob can do this if $2022$ is replaced for $2n$ for any $n \\geq 2$ Turn the numbers into a single permutation $a_1 \\ldots a_{2022}$ of $[2n]$ by reading off the first number on the left then the first number on the right then the second number on the left and so on Thus $1 2$ on the left and $3 4$ on the right would become $1 3 2 4$ (here $n=2$ ) Then the swapping process corresponds to picking two opposite parity elements whose positions are also opposite parity and switching them so $1 3 2 4 \\to 2 3 1 4$ is illegal but $1 3 2 4 \\to 4 3 2 1$ is legal Then it is easy to verify that the number of same parity inversions\u2014i e the number of pairs $i<j$ such that $a_i>a_j$ and $a_i \\equiv a_j \\pmod{2}$ \u2014 has invariant parity whenever we swap $a_i$ and $a_j$ the number of same parity inversions among $(i k)$ and $(k j)$ for $i<k<j$ changes by $\\pm 1$ Since there are an even number of such $k$ the result follows The desired final state has $0$ same parity inversions On the other hand the starting state $3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 \\ldots$ has $1$ same parity inversion so starting with $3 1 5 7 9 \\ldots$ on the left and $2 4 6 8 10 \\ldots$ on the right will make Anna unable to win",

Originally there is one atom in the space and it starts splitting according to the following procedure. If after $n$ minutes there are atoms $a_1, \\dots, a_N$, in the following minute every atom $a_i$ splits into four new atoms, $a_i^{(1)},a_i^{(2)},a_i^{(3)},a_i^{(4)}$. Atoms $a_i^{(j)}$ and $a_k^{(j)}$ are entangled if and only the atoms $a_i$ and $a_k$ were entangled after $n$ minutes.

    "solution": "I will assume the question is asking you the angle bisector is dividing the segment into two parts and ask you the ratio of that lol(my English is bad so im not sure what is trying to say) \n \n So we assume that the midpoint of $EX$ be $J$ the intersection of $CJ$ and the angle bisector of $\\angle{BAC}$ be $N$ Extend $CA$ which meets the perpendicular bisector of $EX$ be $K$ We try to find $\\frac{CN}{JN}$ \n \n We can find that since $AN$ bisects $\\angle{EAF}$ $EA=FA$ so $AN\\bot EF$ which means that $AN||KJ$ so it is then becoming $\\frac{CN}{CJ}=\\frac{CA}{CK}$ \n \n Assume that $AE=EF=x CD=10 x BE=7 x=2+x x=\\frac{5}{2}$ \n \n We find point $Z$ lies on $AB$ which makes that $EZ||XB$ Since $EZ||CB \\triangle{AEZ}\\sim \\triangle{ACB} AZ=7\\cdot \\frac{AE}{AC}=\\frac{7}{4}$ then we can have that $AF=\\frac{5}{2} \\frac{7}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}$ since $BF=7 \\frac{5}{2}=\\frac{9}{2} BX=EZ\\cdot \\frac{BF}{ZF}=18$ \n \n Since $\\triangle{EKX}$ is an isosceles triangle $EK=KX$ we assume that $AK=x KX=\\frac{5}{2}+x$ \n \n Now we can apply LOC in $\\triangle{CKX}$ but we need $\\cos \\angle{ACB}$ at first which is $\\frac{12^2+10^2 7^2}{2\\cdot 10\\cdot 12}=\\frac{13}{16}$ \n \n So applying LOC we have $(10+x)^2+30^2 2\\cdot 30 \\cdot (10+x)\\cdot \\frac{13}{16}=(\\frac{5}{2}+x)^2 x=15$ \n \n $\\frac{CN}{CJ}=\\frac{10}{25}=\\frac{2}{5} \\frac{CN}{NJ}=\\frac{2}{3}$ leads to $\\boxed{5}$ (I'm not sure if my sol is right cuz I dont know what the answer is)",

    "text": "Mellon Game Lab has come up with a concept for a new game: Square Finder. The premise is as follows. You are given an $n\\times n$ grid of squares (for integer $n\\geq 2$), each of which is either blank or has an arrow pointing up, down, left, or right. You are also given a $2\\times 2$ grid of squares that appears somewhere in this grid, possibly rotated. For example, see if you can find the following $2\\times 2$ grid inside the larger $4\\times 4$ grid. Did you spot it? It's in the bottom left, rotated by $90^\\circ$ clockwise. To make the game as interesting as possible, Mellon Game Lab would like the grid to be as large as possible and for no $2\\times 2$ grid to appear more than once in the big grid. The grid above doesn't work, as the following $2\\times 2$ grid appears twice, once in the top left corner (rotated $90^\\circ$ counterclockwise) and once directly below it (overlapping). Let's call a grid that avoids such repeats a repeat-free grid. We are interested in finding out for which $n$ constructing an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid is possible. Here's what we know so far. Any $2\\times 2$ grid is repeat-free, as there is only one subgrid to worry about, and there can't possibly be any repeats. If we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid, we can also construct a $k\\times k$ repeat-free grid for any $k\\leq n$ by just taking the top left $k\\times k$ of the original one we found. By the previous observation, if it is impossible to construct such an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid, we cannot construct a $k\\times k$ repeat-free grid for any $k\\geq n$, as otherwise we could take the top left $n\\times n$ to get one working for $n$. These three observations together tell us that either we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid for all $n\\geq 2$, or there exists some upper limit $N\\geq 2$ such that we can construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid for all $n\\leq N$ but cannot construct one for any $n> N$. Your goal is to determine if such an $N$ exists, and if so, place bounds on its value. More precisely, this problem consists of two parts: a lower bound and an upper bound. For the lower bound, to show that $N\\geq n$ for some $n$, you need to construct an $n\\times n$ repeat-free grid (you do not need to prove your construction works). For the upper bound, to show that $N$ is at most some value $n$, you must prove that it is impossible to construct an $(n+1)\\times (n+1)$ repeat-free grid. Proposed by Connor Gordon and Eric Oh",

    "text": "In this problem, we explore a variant of the Monty Hall Problem. There are $n$ doors numbered $1, \\dots, n$. A single gold coin is placed randomly behind one of the doors, with the probability it is placed behind door $i$ equalling $p_i.$ There are $r$ \"rounds\" in which we may make at most $k$ \"turns\" each, defined as follows: During a \"turn\", you pick two doors and send them to the game host. Then, the host picks one of the two doors in the following manner: If neither door contains the coin, the host randomly picks one with equal probability. If one of the doors contains the coin, the host picks the door which does not have the coin. The host reveals that the picked door does not contain the coin, and opens it. A \"round\" consists of Alice performing at least 1 and at most $k$ turns. After all the turns in round $j$ are complete, suppose there are $d_j$ doors remaining. Bob will compute the probability of each individual door containing the coin. Let $m_j$ be the minimum of these probabilities computed during the $j$th round. Then, Bob awards Alice $d_jm_j$ points. Note that Bob will pay Alice $r$ times, and Alice's total payout is the sum of the $r$ individual payouts. Note that opened doors remain revealed between rounds. Suppose $S$ is some strategy that determines which doors Alice sends to the host. Let $F(S, n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))$ be the minimum possible amount Alice could earn with strategy $S$ for parameters $(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))$, and let \\[G(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))= \\max\\limits _S F(S, n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n)).\\] Find all tuples $(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))$ for which $G(n,k,r,(p_1, \\dots, p_n))=r.$ You may find it useful to consider lists where each element of a list is at most double the prior element.

    "solution": "Context I got 59 points in contest doing this problem all by myself the highest of any team (yes flex) (my greatest accomplishment) (we won TCS overall) \n \n Most proofs are highly unrigorous given the time limit Outline of my solution in contest including a little bit of my thought process Since I knew everyone else would go for the first two problems I decided to go to this one For the first 50 minutes I completely regretted this decision At first sight the problem looks super intimidating I began by reading the problem Then reading it again Then getting distracted and reading it again After a while (around 20 minutes probably because I kept getting distracted) I was able to understand the notation In fact under the $G(n k r (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ I wrote \"num doors num turns num rounds probabilities\" to help me remember the notation better Throughout the problems assume that any provided constructions for probabilities can be permuted by symmetry I began with the first subproblem (3 points) Show that $G(3 1 1 (p_1 p_2 p_3))$ can be less than $1$ For this I tested a few probabilities and came to the following lemma When opening two doors with probabilities $p$ and $q$ the unopened door will get weighted by a factor of $2$ In other words the remaining probabilities will be $0 2p$ or $0 2q$ scaled so that the sum of all the probabilities is still $1$ This is easy to prove by conditional probability concepts This is sufficient to solve this problem and (iirc) the example I came up with was $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac13 \\frac16\\right)$ \n \n The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(n n 2 1 (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ can be less than $1$ for all $n \\geq 3$ \n \n For this I made the following claim Claim It is always optimal to open the doors with the smallest probabilities The reason for this is because if we want to maximize $F$ then we need all the probabilities to be as close to each other as possible In my proof I didn't really account for the case where we might want to make them farther apart temporarily then make them closer later However I assumed that this would just be a simple yet annoying edge case check so I didn't mention it At this point I realized that the problem would be simplest if after combining two doors the sum of the probabilities remained the same This would imply that the doors combined must have the same probability This gave me the idea for the following solution We can simply take the probabilities $\\left(\\frac 12 \\frac 13 \\frac 16 \\frac 1{12} \\dots \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n 2}} \\frac{1}{6\\cdot 2^{n 2}}\\right)$ and combining the smallest two probabilities will collapse into a case with $n \\mapsto n 1$ since the sum of all the probabilities remains the same The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(3 1 1 (p_1 p_2 p_3))$ can be $1$ This is easy to do with $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac14 \\frac14\\right)$ \n \n The next subproblem (10 points) is to show that there exists a tuple $(n k 1 (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ with $n>2024 k>506$ such that for all increasing $k'$ from $1$ to $k$ increases $G(n k' 1 (p_1 \\dots p_n))$ and the value is $1$ when $k'=k$ \n \n For this I simply noted that when the probabilities are $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac14 \\dots \\frac1{2^{n 1}} \\frac1{2^{n 1}}\\right)$ and there are no more turns then the final score is $\\frac{n}{2^{n 1}}$ Since each turn decreases $n$ we can simply take this set of probabilities for sufficiently large $n > k > 2025$ This is because the probability increases as $n$ increases until we reach $n=2$ \n \n At this point I tried to get some of my team members to help me to no avail Three of them were working on the problem one construction two on the bound and two more were working on problem 2 The next subproblem (6 points) Determine when $G(4 k r (p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4)) = r$ \n \n I immediately thought to do casework on $r$ we are given that $rk+1 < n$ Therefore we check when $r=2$ so $k=1$ Then we require that after $1$ turn the probabilities are all equal and after another turn the probabilities are once again all equal However in one turn the probabilities $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac13 \\frac13\\right)$ can only be turned into $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac23\\right)$ \n \n Therefore we must instead have $r=1$ The set of probabilities which can be reduced to $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac13 \\frac13\\right)$ in exactly one move consists only of $\\left(\\frac13 \\frac13 \\frac16 \\frac16\\right)$ Note that in this case $k$ can be either $1$ or $2$ To reduce to $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac12\\right)$ in exactly two moves we must have $\\left(\\frac12 \\frac14 \\frac18 \\frac18\\right)$ and $k=2$ \n \n Now we continue to the problem of showing when $G(n k r (p_1 \\dots p_n)) = r$ The points are as follows 5 points for $k=1$ \n 10 points for $k=2 r=1$ \n 20 points for $r=1$ with exactly $k$ turns per round \n 35 points for $r=1$ \n 55 points for $r=1 2$ \n 75 points for a full solution \n \n When I saw these scoring guidelines I only had around 15 minutes left I first tried $k=1$ thinking that the lack of a restriction on $r$ is strange Of course it turns out this case is trivial I quickly realized $r$ must be $1$ simply because you cannot go from one position of all equal probabilities to another position of all equal probabilities in one turn I then decided to try $r=1$ My conjecture for this based on previous problems is simply to modify the power of $2$ strategy from the $n=4$ case However I did not really provide a specific proof for this Specifically we could have some amount of equal probabilities then use the dividing by $2$ strategy constantly I here quickly realized that the 20 point case is isomorphic to the 35 point case because we can simply just take all the values of $k$ bigger than the exact number of turns necessary Anyways it took me 10 very unfortunate minutes to actually calculate the annoying values and indices Eventually the probabilities which can be collapsed into an all equal case in exactly $k$ turns is \n \n \\[\n\\left(\n\\frac{1}{n k+1} \\frac{1}{n k+1} \\dots \\frac{1}{n k+1} \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2} \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2^2} \\dots \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2^{k}} \\frac{1}{(n k+1)2^{k}}\n\\right)\n\\] where $\\frac{1}{n k+1}$ occurs $n k$ times Then for the 35 point case we can simply take anything larger than this $k$ as the new $k$ value to produce a valid tuple Once I did this I had around 5 minutes left but instead of trying to prove my unproven lemmas I wondered how it would be possible to go from one set of equal probabilities to another smaller set thereby giving an $r=2$ solution I came to the conclusion that the only way this is possible is if the $n k+1$ in the previous problem is even and we can combine pairs to form another equal configuration I was definitely unable to support this conclusion with any proof but nonetheless I wrote up my thoughts Clearly if this is true the general solution is much the same as $r=2$ \n \n We start with a configuration such as the tuple mentioned above and it suffices that $2^r$ divides $n k+1$ However in the contest I only had time to writeup my ideas for extending to $r=2$ I said that $n k+1$ would have to be even and we could combine in pairs and with no time remaining added that \"It is easy to extend this idea to larger $r$ \" \n \n If I ever decide to prove many of these claims rigorously I will definitely return",

The island takes the shape of a unit square, and the treasure (which we treat as a single point) could be buried under any point on the island. To assist you in finding his treasure, Scotty has left a peculiar instrument. To use this instrument, you may draw any directed line (possibly one that never hits the island!), and the instrument will tell you whether the treasure lies to the \"left\" or the \"right\" of the line.* However, Scotty also left a trap! If the instrument ever reports ``left'' three times in a row or ``right'' three times in a row, the island will suddenly sink into the sea, submerging the treasure forever and drowning you and your crew! You want to avoid this at all costs. To minimize the amount of energy spent digging, you would like to narrow down the set of possible locations of the treasure to be as small as possible. However, Scotty left one last trick; you can only use the instrument 12 times before it breaks! Devise an algorithm to use the instrument no more than 12 times that can never result in the island sinking and narrows the worst-case space of possible locations of the treasure to have as small an area as possible. * Where \"left\" or \"right\" is taken with respect to an observer walking along the line in its designated direction. There is also a probability zero chance the treasure is precisely on the line; this won't affect anything, but for the sake of clarity let's say the instrument reports \"left\" in this case.

In a single $m$-perfect shuffle, you divide the deck into $m$ piles with $n$ consecutive cards in each pile. You take one card from each pile, in order of the piles, for $n$ times to form the new deck. (The $m$-perfect shuffle is deterministic) For example, if the cards are labeled 12345678 where $n=4$ and $m=2$, you divide the deck into 1234 and 5678, and after one $2$-perfect shuffle you get 15263748.

Find an algorithm that, in at most $k$ steps, outputs the smallest positive number of $m$-perfect shuffle after which the deck is exactly the same as the original deck. In each step, you can do one arithmetic operation in $\\{+, -, *, /, \\bmod\\}$, do one comparison, break out of a loop, or store one number to a specific location of an array. You can use the following precomputed numbers of steps in your solution: Checking if $a$ divides $b$ for any two integers $a$ and $b$ takes 2 steps because you need to compute $b \\bmod a$ then compare with $0$. A loop over $k$ iterations takes $2k$ steps because you need to increment the loop index by $1$ $k$ times and check the loop guard $k$ times.

    "solution": "This problem is mine and in fact it is the one I referred to in this blog post In the interest of the Contest Collections page I'll post the official solution Solution Before trudging onward it helps to deduce a few properties of any system of congruences which is valid First remark that the values of $\\pi(1)$ $\\pi(5)$ and $\\pi(7)$ are independent of values of other congruences In other words when building a valid permutation it suffices to compute the other six values and then randomly assign these three at the end Now remark that $\\pi(km)\\equiv\\pi(k)\\pmod k$ for all $k$ and $m$ for which the previous congruence is valid This is because the modulus of $N$ modulo $km$ determines the modulus of $N$ mod $k$ and so the results must be consistent The following consequences are direct colloraries of this fact All even indexes i e all $\\pi(2k)$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\setminus\\{0\\}$ must have the same parity For example $\\pi(2)\\equiv\\pi(8)\\pmod 2$ (The same is not necessarily true of the odds however in particular when $\\pi(2)$ is odd one of $\\pi(1)$ $\\pi(3)$ $\\ldots$ $\\pi(9)$ must also be odd This is a result of the fact that $9$ is itself odd ) \n As an extension $\\pi(8) \\pi(4)$ must be an integral multiple of $4$ Since $9 1=8$ we need either $|\\pi(8) \\pi(4)|=4$ or $|\\pi(8) \\pi(4)|=8 $ \n Note that $\\pi(3)\\equiv\\pi(6)\\equiv\\pi(9)\\pmod 3$ This in particular means that \\[\\{\\pi(3) \\pi(6) \\pi(9)\\}\\in\\{\\{1 4 7\\} \\{2 5 8\\} \\{3 6 9\\}\\} \\] Subject to all these conditions a solution exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem on the moduli $5$ $7$ $8$ and $9$ \n \n We now have enough information to start counting We split the calculation into two cases $\\textbf{CASE 1 }\\pi(2k)\\equiv 0\\pmod 2$ $\\forall k$ In this case remark that $\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\}$ can only be one of $\\{2 6\\}$ or $\\{4 8\\}$ Noting the third bullet point above we see that in the former case we must have $\\pi(6)=4$ in the latter case we must have $\\pi(6)=6$ (why?) From these $\\pi(2)$ is uniquely determined and there are two ways to choose the ordered pair $(\\pi(3) \\pi(9))$ Thus in total there are $2\\times 2\\times 2=8$ possibilities in this case $\\textbf{CASE 2 }\\pi(2k)\\equiv 1\\pmod 2$ $\\forall k$ In this case there are more choices for the set $\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\}$ In fact there are four $\\{1 5\\}$ $\\{3 7\\}$ $\\{5 9\\}$ and $\\{1 9\\}$ Because of this we need to be more careful about how we enumerate the possible permutations which work We again split into two cases $\\textbf{SUBCASE 1 }\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\} = \\{1 5\\}$ or $\\{5 9\\}$ Note that in these cases there are two possible values of $\\pi(6)$ in the first one $\\pi(6)\\in\\{3 9\\}$ while in the second $\\pi(6)\\in\\{1 7\\}$ Regardless of which member of which set is chosen the other element in the set must also appear as some other element in $\\{\\pi(3) \\pi(9)\\}$ For example if $\\pi(6)=1$ then either $\\pi(3)=7$ or $\\pi(9)=7$ Combining this with the fact that all $\\pi(2k)$ have the same parity we see that $\\pi(2)$ is actually fixed in these situations Thus for each of the four possibilities for $(\\pi(4) \\pi(8))$ there are two possible values of $\\pi(6)$ and two possibilities for $(\\pi(3) \\pi(9))$ for $16$ different permutations which work $\\textbf{SUBCASE 2 }\\{\\pi(4) \\pi(8)\\} = \\{3 7\\}$ or $\\{1 9\\}$ In contrast with the above note that in these two cases $\\pi(6)$ is fixed which means there the value of $\\pi(2)$ can vary More specifically for each of the four possibilities for $(\\pi(4) \\pi(8))$ there are two possible values for $\\pi(2)$ and two possibilities for $(\\pi(3) \\pi(9))$ for $16$ different permutations which work Thus in this total case $32$ systems are possible Finally there are three numbers left and they can be assigned to $\\pi(1)$ $\\pi(5)$ and $\\pi(7)$ in $3!=6$ ways Thus the total number of consistent systems is $6(8+32)=\\boxed{240}$",

    "solution": "In the interest of the Contests Page I'll post the official solution to this problem This problem was proposed by me but the solution below was discovered by AoPS user codyj \n \n Solution We first make use of a lemma LEMMA Let $F(v)$ be a linear transformation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and define \\[F(\\mathcal{P})=\\{F(v)\\ |\\ v\\in\\mathcal{P}\\} \\] Then $F(\\mathcal{P})$ is also a parabola Proof Omitted Use the fact that a conic of the form \\[ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f=0\\] is a parabola if and only if $b^2 4ac=0$ \n \n With this in mind scale the $y$ axis by $\\tfrac5{12}$ This scaling preserves the trisection property of lines and furthermore preserves the tangency of $\\mathcal{P}$ to the $x$ and $y$ axes and so the answer to the original question will be $\\tfrac{12}5$ the answer to this new problem Furthermore rotate the entire diagram $45^\\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin By the arctangent formula a line with slope $m$ in this frame has a slope of $\\tfrac{1 m}{1+m}$ in the original frame so it's not hard to transform back and forth Let $\\mathcal{P}'$ be the parabola which results from these transformations then $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=x$ and $y= x$ and the directrix of $\\mathcal{P'}$ is a line parallel to the line $y=0$ This in turn means that $y=cx^2+d$ for some constants $c$ and $d$ To deal with the fact that $\\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=\\pm x$ note that this means the equations $y=cx^2 x+d$ and $y=cx^2+x+d$ each have exactly one root This means their discriminants are zero so $1^2 4cd = 0\\implies d=\\tfrac{1}{4c}$ In fact we can make $c$ arbitrary due to scaling so take $c=1$ This gives $d=\\tfrac14$ so the equation of $\\mathcal{P}'$ is now $y=x^2+\\tfrac14$ \n \n Consider any $\\mathcal{P}'$ friendly segment with endpoints $( 3a 3a)$ and $(3b 3b)$ We want $( a+2b a+2b)$ and $( 2a+b 2a+b)$ to both be points on $\\mathcal{P}'$ This gives the system of equations \\[\\begin{cases}a+2b&=( a+2b)^2+\\frac14 \\\\2a+b&=( 2a+b)^2+\\frac14 \\end{cases}\\] Subtracting the first equation from the second yields \\[a b=( 2a+b)^2 ( a+2b)^2=(2a b)^2 (a 2b)^2=3(a+b)(a b) \\] Hence either $a=b$ or $a+b=\\tfrac13$ In the former case this segment is horizontal It's clear by the Intermediate Value Theorem (or an analogous argument) that there are precisely two such $\\mathcal{P}'$ friendly segments contributing $2\\cdot\\tfrac{0 1}{0+1}= 2$ to the sum of the slopes of the lines On the other hand if $a+b=\\tfrac13$ then let $m=\\tfrac{b a}{b+a}=3(b a)=6b 1$ be the slope of the line in question We wish to find the sum of the values of \\[\\dfrac{m 1}{m+1}=\\dfrac{6b 2}{6b}=1 \\frac1{3b} \\] i e the slopes of all lines after they have been rotated $45$ degrees Note that by plugging $a+b=\\tfrac13$ into the first equation of the system we get the quadratic \\[\\frac13+b=\\left( \\frac13+3b\\right)^2+\\frac14 \\] Expanding and simplifying yields that this quadratic is equivalent to \\[9b^2 3b+\\frac1{36}=0 \\] so by Vieta's formulas if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the two roots of the above quadratic then \\[\\left(1 \\frac1{3b_1}\\right)+\\left(1 \\frac1{3b_2}\\right) = 2 \\frac13\\left(\\dfrac{b_1+b_2}{b_1b_2}\\right)=2 \\frac13\\left(\\frac{3}{1/36}\\right) = 2 \\frac1{36} \\] Therefore the sum of all the slopes of the lines for the original parabola $\\mathcal{P}$ is \\[\\dfrac{12}5\\left[ 2+\\left(2 \\frac1{36}\\right)\\right]= \\frac{432}5\\] and the requested answer is $432+5=\\boxed{437}$",
