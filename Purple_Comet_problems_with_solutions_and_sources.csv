The area of the figure is $45$ and hence area of each square is $45/5=9$ and so side length if each square is $3$. Now, perimeter of the figure is $$\mathcal{P}=AB+BC+CD+DE+EF+FG+GH+HI+IJ+JK+KL+LM+MA.$$Notice that $AB=BC=CD=DE=EF=FG=GH=IJ=JK=KL=LM=3$. Now, $HI+MA=MI-HA=6-3=3$. So, $$\mathcal{P}=11\times 3+3=\boxed{36}.$$

When we put everything over a common denominator we can repeatedly substitute values in for $k$ (as this expression must be true for all $k$) and make expressions equal to $0$. For example, when we substitute $k=2$, all terms in the numerator except

$$A(k-1)(k)(k+1)(k+2)(k+3) \longrightarrow 120A = 8 \longrightarrow A = \frac{1}{15}$$

become $0$. Substituting $k = 1,0,-1,-2,-3$ gives that $B = -\frac{1}{3}$, $C=\frac{2}{3}$, $D=-\frac{2}{3}$, $E = \frac{1}{3}$, and $F=-\frac{1}{15}$. Then we get that our sum is

$$\sum\limits_{k=4}^{\infty} \frac{1}{15}\left(\frac{1}{k-2}-\frac{1}{k+3}\right) -\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{k-1}-\frac{1}{k+2}\right) + \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{k}-\frac{1}{k+1}\right)$$

each of these sums telescopes and we get

$$\frac{1}{15}\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{6}\right)-\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}\right) + \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)$$$$\frac{1}{15}\cdot\frac{29}{20} - \frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{47}{60} + \frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{4} = \frac{87 - 235 + 150}{900} = \frac{2}{900} = \frac{1}{450}$$

Out of the $4200$ digits ($4380 - 180$) that come from 1, 4, 9, ... , and 81, $\frac{4200}{5} = 840$ are 1's. Remember that the total number of digits Allison writes is $4380$.

The only way that a three-digit number sums up to an even number is if all of them are even or 2 are odd and 1 is even.



Case #1: All 3 are even

There are $5$ one digit even numbers: $0,2,4,6,8$ Thus our answer is $4*4*3=48$ because we cannot use a $0$ in the hundreds place

There exist 2-subcases for this one: If it starts with an even number or not.



Subcase #1: Starts with an odd number

If it starts with an odd number then there are $5*4*5*2=200$ this is because there are $5$ choices for the hundreds digit, $4$ choices for the next odd digit, $5$ choices for the even digit and since the even and odd digits that are not the hundreds digit can change we need to multiply by $2$



Subcase #2: Starts with an even number

Case 1: Distance is 1

This is just finding the number of edges there are on this graph and by Inspection there are $24$



Case 2: Distance is 2

If neither point is on a corner than there are 2 subcases.

If both points are on the boundary of the square but not the diagonal than there are $4$ ways

If only 1 point is on the boundary of the square then there are $2$ ways per point thus $2*8=16$ ways

If only 1 point is on a corner than there are $2$ ways per corner for a total of $8$ ways

If both of the points is on the side of the square then there are $2$ ways per point thus $\frac{8*3}{2}=12$ ways

If only 1 of the points is on the boundary than there are $8*1$ ways

Thus there are a total of $4+8+12+8=32$ ways



Case 4: Distance is 4

If one of the points are on the corners than we see that for each corner there are $3$ possible points that the other point could be thus $4*3=12$

If neither point is on the corner than let us choose one of the $8$ points that are on the side of the square and we see that there are only $2$ possibilities for the other point thus there are $\tfrac{8*2}{2}=8.$

Thus the total number of ways such that the distance is $4$ is $12+8=20$

By inspection there is only $8$ ways to do this by making sure that at least one of the points is on a corner.



Case 6: Distance is 6

By Inspection there are only $2$ ways to do this.

Note that $2016 = 2^{5} \cdot 3^{2} \cdot 7$. We may now do casework on $d$:

\[(x-1)(x+1)x = 2016\]

Let us split the pentagonal prism into $2$ parts: The top part which is where the isoceles triangle is and the bottom part which is the rectangle underneath the isoceles triangle.

The top part is just the area of the triangle with side lengths $10,10,12$ which is $48$ multiplied by $10$ which is $480$

The bottom part is just the area of a box with sidelengths $7,12,30$ thus the volume is $7*12*30=2520$

The top part area is the base which is $12*12=144$ multiplied by the height which is $8$ divided by $3.$ Thus the volume of the top part is $\frac{144*8}{3}=48*3=144$

The bottom part area is simply the area of a box which has side lengths $12,12,7$ thus the volume of that box is $12*12*7=1008$

SolutionLet there be $100$ total jelly beans in the jar.



We have the following information:


$54$ jelly beans are red.


$30$ jelly beans are green.


$16$ jelly beans are blue.



Now from:


Quote:
Alan then removed the same number of red jelly beans and green jelly beans from the jar so that now $20\%$ of the jelly beans in the jar are blue.



We can deduce that there must be $16\cdot 5 = 80$ jelly beans in the jar after Alan removes jelly beans, because no blue jelly beans are removed and the blue jelly beans represent $\frac{1}{5}$ the total number of jelly beans.



Therefore, $100-80=20$ total green and red jelly beans were removed. Since an equal number of red and green jelly beans were removed, $10$ red jelly beans were removed.

Very long bashLet DE=EF=1 for simplicity. Obviously angle FEG is 30 degrees, so FG=DC=$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$, and the side length of the hexagon is $\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$. So AD=$\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Then $\tan AFE$ (let's call it x)=$\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$. Then $\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}$

$\sin x=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}\cdot \cos x$

$\sin^2 x=\frac{4}{3}\cdot \cos^2 x$

$\sin^2 x=\frac{4}{3}-\frac{4}{3}\sin^2 x$

$\frac{7}{3}\sin^2 x=\frac{4}{3}$

$\sin^2 x=\frac{4}{7}$

$\sin x=\frac{2\sqrt{7}}{7}$ (since sin x is obviously positive)

$\cos x=\sqrt{1-\frac{4}{7}}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{7}}=\frac{\sqrt{21}}{7}$

From exterior angles, $\theta=x+30$. So first we find $\sin {\theta}$:

$\sin(x+30)$

$\sin{x}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\cos{x}\cdot \frac{1}{2}$

$\frac{2\sqrt{7}}{7}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{21}}{7}\cdot \frac{1}{2}$

$\frac{2\sqrt{21}}{14}+\frac{\sqrt{21}}{14}$

$\frac{3\sqrt{21}}{14}$

So that above stuff squared gives us:

$\frac{9\cdot 21}{196}=\frac{27}{28}$

So 27+28=55.

This is also exactly the same number of ways he could flip the coins and observe exactly 2 tails.



The binomial coefficients 7C0, 7C1, 7C2, 7C3, 7C4, 7C5, 7C6, 7C7 comprise the 7th row of Pascal's triangle. Numerically, this is 1, 7, 21, 35, 35, 21, 7, 1.



Back to the problem:



If Fred flips at least 3 tails, then he flips at most 4 heads. Thus, the total number of outcomes where Ted flips at least 3 tails is identical to the number of outcomes where he flips no more than 4 heads, which is 7C0 + 7C1 + 7C2 + 7C3 + 7C4 = 1 + 7 + 21 + 35 + 35 = 99.



The number of favorable outcomes, where Ted flips at least 2 heads (and at most 4 heads) is 7C2 + 7C3 + 7C4 = 21 + 35 + 35 = 91.



So, the ratio sought is 91/99.

Below, 0 is off and 1 is on.

A   B   C

Case 1: 1   0   0

Case 2: 0   1   0

Case 1:

We need to choose 2 of the switches to switch twice, or one of the switches to switch four times.

For the former, we must choose 1 switch not to touch, and multiply that by $\binom{4}{2}$ for the order of the clicks: $3\cdot6=18$.

For the latter, we just need to choose one switch $\Rightarrow 3$.



Case 2:

These two are the same, we need to make A go on and B to go off.

This takes up two moves, so we need to turn another switch on and off again.

Thus we can click A or C thrice, resulting in $4/cdot2=8$ possibilities, or A once, C once, and B twice, with $4/cdot3=12$.



Case 3 is the same as Case 2, except C needs to go off instead of B.

Let us say that $DC=CE=1$

Let us also say that $AC=CB=x$

The key step is to realize that the area which shows that the perimeter of $\triangle DEF$ is less than the length of the diameter is an ellipse!

Thus we see that the ellipse has a semi minor axis length of $\sqrt{(x-1)^2-1^2}=\sqrt{x^2-2x}.$ We can also see that the major axis of this ellipse is equivalent to $2x-2$ thus the area of this ellipse is $(x-1)\sqrt{x^2-x}.$

Now we create the equation using the probability given to us.

$$\frac{(x-1)\sqrt{x^2-x}}{x^2}=\frac{17}{128}$$$$128(x-1)\sqrt{x^2-x}=17x^2$$After huge bash we have $x=\tfrac{32}{15}$

We are looking for integer or half-integer radii.



The error in the area of a circle will be given by $E = (\pi - 3.14)r^2$.



$3.14159 < \pi < 3.14160$.  So we can get upper and lower values on estimates of $E$:



$(3.14160 - 3.14)r^2 > E > (3.14159 - 3.14)r^2$



$0.00160r^2 > E > 0.00159r^2$

Plugging in $E=1$ to find when the error hits $1$ exactly, we get:



$16 r^2 > 10000 > 15.9r^2$



Thus we have $15.9r^2 < 10000$ and $10000 < 16r^2$.



From the second equation, we quickly get that $\frac{100}{4} < r$, or $25 < r$.  So, we try $r = 25$ and $r = 25.5$ to see which one will work.

At $r=25$, the estimated area is $3.14\cdot 25^2 = 1962.5$.  Since the area is strictly less than the estimate when $\pi = 3.1416$, the error is strictly less than $1$.



At $r=25.5$, the actual area is between $3.14159\cdot 650.25 $ and $3.1416\cdot 650.25$.  Thus, the area is between $2042.8189$ and $2042.8254$.

$\star$ all other pairs of the five integers are relatively prime.",,Purple Comet 2010 High School #15,https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c149h422100p2386010,,,2010,Purple Comet 2010 HS Problem 15,,"Y by Adventure10, Mango247Here is my attempt at a solution, though I am not very rigorous in my optimisation:



Define $b, c, d$ as the 'first middle', 'second middle' and 'third middle' numbers respectively, and define $a, e$ as the outer numbers.



Since we require all pairs except adjacent ones to be relatively prime, we can conclude that each of the primes in the middle numbers' factorisation must occur in exactly two numbers, while the outer numbers will contain each a prime that occurs only once.

Furthermore, all these primes are distinct.



To optimise, we should use the five smallest primes (notice I say this without proof).

The five smallest primes are $2,3,5,7$ and $11$.

Now, to optimise further, take the biggest primes ($11$ and $7$) and include them as factors of the outer numbers. This ensures that they occur in only one of the five numbers. Moreover, we can get away with at least one number which is prime itself as one of the outer numbers. Make $7$ this prime.

$(11\cdot p_1,b,c,d,7)$

Next, place the next largest prime $5$ as a factor of the second middle number. This will ensure that between any two numbers, a third number smaller than either of the two lies.

$(11 \cdot p_1,b,5\cdot p_3,d,7)$

Place $3$ between $5$ and $7$ instead of between $11$ and $5$, to get smaller products.

$(11\cdot p_1,2\cdot p_2,5\cdot p_3,3\cdot p_4,7\cdot p_5)$

Finally, choose the smallest possible $p_i$'s so that every number except those adjacent in the list would be relatively prime.

Refer to the above diagram. Firstly, notice that, by the symmetry of the problem, $ PR $ is tangent to the circle centered at $ Q $. Let $ QR=r $. Notice that $ QP=8-r $ and $ QO=10-r $. By the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ QPR $, we have $ PR=\sqrt{(8-r)^2-r^2}=\sqrt{64-16r}=4\sqrt{4-r} $. Thus, $ OR=3+4\sqrt{4-r} $. From the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangle $ ROQ $, we have



\[ r^2+(3+4\sqrt{4-r})^2=(10-r)^2 \]

\[ r^2+64-16r+9+24\sqrt{4-r}=r^2-20r+100 \]

Since $\angle DCB=\angle ABC=\frac{900}{7}^{\circ}$, $\angle BCE=\angle EBC=180-\frac{900}{7}=\frac{360}{7}^{\circ}$, so $\angle CEB=180-2\left(\frac{360}{7}\right)=\frac{540}{7}^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle DEF=180-\frac{540}{7}=\frac{720}{7}^{\circ}$. The answer is $720+7=\boxed{727}$.

We subtract the area of quarter-circle $ABC$.  To find that, note that $AC$ is a chord (specifically, a chord that is NOT a diameter!) of length $18$ of some circle with center $O$ (which is NOT the midpoint of $AC$).  Also note that $\angle AOC = 90^\circ$.  From that, and the fact that $OA = OC$ because $A$ and $C$ are on circle $O$, we have a $45-45-90$ triangle $AOC$ with hypotenuse $AC$, and thus $OA = OC = \frac{18}{\sqrt{2}} = 9\sqrt{2}$, which is the radius of circle $O$.



We have the radius of the circle, so the area of the whole quarter-sector is $\frac{1}{4}\pi \cdot (9\sqrt{2})^2 = \frac{81}{2}\pi$.  But the area under $ABC$ but above line $AC$ isn't a quarter sector - it's a quarter sector with right triangle cut out.  The right triangle is $AOC$, which has area $\frac{1}{2}AO^2 = \frac{1}{2}\cdot (9\sqrt{2})^2 = 81$.



Thus, the area under $ABC$ but over $AC$ is $\frac{81}{2}\pi - 81$.  We subtract this from $\frac{81}{2}\pi$, the area of the original semicircle we got in the first sentence, to get $\boxed{81}$

$27N + 18P + 31M = 31$

Solving this using linear combinations of the first and second equations should help.

We want to multiply the first equation by $a$ and the second equation by $b$ such that:



$13a + 27b = 24$



$26a + 18b = 120 \rightarrow 13a + 9b = 60$



Hopefully the $M$ column will also work out.  It's not guaranteed other than by the fact that Purple Comet only gives solvable problems.



Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $18b = -36 \rightarrow b =-2$

Plugging in $b=-2$ into either equation gives $13a = 78 \rightarrow a = 6$



This tells us that we want to take $6$ of the first equation, and add it with $-2$ of the second equation.

Doing so gives:

Note that $h_1(0) = 44$ and $h_1(2) = 47$, which makes sense, and since the growth is linear, this must be the right function.



Similarly, $h_2(t) = 80 + \frac{5}{6}t$.  We set $h_1(t) = h_2(t)$ to find the time when both plants are at the same height.



$44 + \frac{3}{2}t = 80 + \frac{5}{6}t$



$\left(\frac{3}{2} - \frac{5}{6}\right)t = 80 - 44$



$\frac{2}{3}t = 36$



$t = \frac{3}{2}\cdot 36$



$t = \boxed{54}$ years.



Fast but error-prone wayAn alternate way to think of the problem (which actually involves similar math, but avoids some fractions) is that in $6$ years, the first plant grows $3 \cdot 3 = 9$ centimeters, while the second plant grows $5$ centimeters.  Thus, the shorter plant ""gains"" $9 - 5 = 4$ centimeters on the taller plant in $6$ years.  The plant needs to gain a total of $80 - 44 = 36$ centimeters, so it will take $\frac{36}{4} = 9$ ""bundles"" of $6$ years, for a total of $\boxed{54}$ years.

Define $a_n$ as the number of ways to have such an arrangement with n people.  Clearly $a_1=3$ and we will define $a_0=1$ because there exists only one such arrangement.  Now consider adding another person on, WLOG, the right end of the row.  When we add another person, there are 2 cases: either the previous far right person has their leg to the right and could potentially cause a problem and the next person must face right or put their feet down, or there is no potential problem and any orientation is possible for the next person.  Note that we can add a right facing leg to the end no matter what, so the number of right facing cases in $a_n$ is equal to $a_{n-1}$.  Thus the number of non-potentially problematic cases is $a_n-a_{n-1}$, and we arrive at our formula: $a_{n+1}=2a_{n-1}+3(a_n-a_{n-1}) = 3a_n-a_{n-1}$.  So we get:

,A concrete sewer pipe fitting is shaped like a cylinder with diameter $48$ with a cone on top. A cylindrical hole of diameter $30$ is bored all the way through the center of the fitting as shown.

We can break this pipe into two pieces, the cylinder and the conical portion.



The volume of the cylinder is simply $(60)(24^2 \pi)=34560\pi$.



The volume of the conical portion can be found by completing the cone and finding the volume of it.  Then subtract out the volume of the smaller cone that was cut off.  We want to find the height of the actual cone.



Thus, we draw an isosceles triangle with base 48 and a line parallel to the base with endpoints on the legs with length 30.  Let the height of the smaller triangle be $h$, then by similar triangles, we have

\[\frac{48}{30}=\frac{h+20}{h}\implies \frac{8}{5}=1+\frac{20}{h} \implies \frac{20}{h}=\frac{3}{5} \implies h=\frac{100}{3}\]

Therefore, we have the volume of the conical portion to be

\begin{align*}&\left(\frac13\right)(24^2\pi)\left(\frac{100}{3}+20\right)-\left(\frac13\right)(15^2\pi)\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)
\\=&\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\left[(24^2)\left(\frac{160}{3}\right)-(15^2)\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)\right] \\
=&\left(\frac{3^2\pi}{3}\right)\left[ \frac{(64)(160)}{3}-\frac{(25)(100)}{3} \right] \\
=& (3\pi)\left(\frac{10240-2500}{3}\right) \\
=& 7740\pi
\end{align*}

Thus, the total volume without the hole is $34560\pi+7740\pi=42300\pi$.



The volume of the hole is $(80)(15^2\pi )=18000\pi$.

We can break this pipe into two pieces, the cylinder and the conical portion.



The volume of the cylinder is simply $(60)(24^2 \pi)=34560\pi$.



The volume of the conical portion can be found by completing the cone and finding the volume of it.  Then subtract out the volume of the smaller cone that was cut off.  We want to find the height of the actual cone.



Thus, we draw an isosceles triangle with base 48 and a line parallel to the base with endpoints on the legs with length 30.  Let the height of the smaller triangle be $h$, then by similar triangles, we have

\[\frac{48}{30}=\frac{h+20}{h}\implies \frac{8}{5}=1+\frac{20}{h} \implies \frac{20}{h}=\frac{3}{5} \implies h=\frac{100}{3}\]

Therefore, we have the volume of the conical portion to be

\begin{align*}&\left(\frac13\right)(24^2\pi)\left(\frac{100}{3}+20\right)-\left(\frac13\right)(15^2\pi)\left(\frac{100}{3}\right)

Thus, the total volume without the hole is $34560\pi+7740\pi=42300\pi$.



The volume of the hole is $(80)(15^2\pi )=18000\pi$.

answerNo one has answered this so I will try the way I do it. Hope it is not considered too much for this thread. It is not my idea to confuse anyone.



I tried simple ideas of counting it up by they seemed too tedious for me, or I missed a good idea. Maybe someone else can help.



The number of solutions to x + y + z = 100 with z>y>x>0 is:



$g(x)= \left (+... +x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x \right )  \left (+... + x^{12}+x^{10}+x^8+x^6+x^4+x^2 \right )  \left ( +... +x^{12}+x^9+x^6+x^3 \right ) $



$ g(x)= \frac{x}{1-x} \cdot  \frac{x^2}{1-x^2} \cdot  \frac{x^3}{1-x^3} $



We want the coefficient of x^100.



$g(x) = x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{(1-x)\left(1-x^2\right)\left(1-x^3\right)} $



We could immediately get the recurrence for the coefficients of x^n.



$ a(n)=a(n-6)-a(n-5)-a(n-4)+a(n-2)+a(n-1) $



Or you can compute the coefficient of x^100 by partial fractions.



$  \frac{1}{(1-x)\left(1-x^2\right)\left(1-x^3\right)}= \frac{x+2}{9 \left(x^2+x+1\right)}  -\frac{17}{72 (x-1)}+\frac{1}{8 (x+1)}+ \\ \\ \frac{1}{4 (x-1)^2}-\frac{1}{6 (x-1)^3} $



$ -\frac{1}{9}+\frac{17}{72}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{95}{4}+\frac{\binom{96}{2}}{6} = 784 $



The answer is 784.

The CodeSo I created a list with all the possible multipliers and create three variables $i,j,k$ where $i \le j \le k$.  That way, I can prevent over-counting.  Below is my code:

multipliers = [1,2,3,5,7] #Possible numbers I can multiplywanted = 0for i in range(0,5):  for j in range(i,5):    for k in range(j,5):      wanted += (multipliers[i] * multipliers[j] * multipliers[k]) #Multiply and addprint(wanted) #Print the resultmultipliers = [1,2,3,5,7] #Possible numbers I can multiply

for i in range(0,5):

    for k in range(j,5):
      wanted += (multipliers[i] * multipliers[j] * multipliers[k]) #Multiply and add

I originally had the answer 1931 since 1 doesn't have any prime factors.  However, having 0 prime factors also works, so the answer is $\boxed{1932}$.

SolutionLet C=the cost and N=the number of items produced.  We have the inverse proportion to be written as $C\sqrt{N}=2100\sqrt{10}$.  However, we want to break even.  The amount of money gathered after selling all the items is $30N$ and we want that to be $C$.  Therefore, we have two equations now - $C\sqrt{N}=2100\sqrt{10}$ and $30N=C$.

The number of ways the yellow candies can be eaten before any of the red ones are eaten can be found by placing all the yellow candies in order and the red candies in order.  The number of ways is found by finding the number of ways the blue candies can be put into the slots between each candy.  There are 7 slots and 6 blue candies.  Thus, this is just a stars and bars problem with 6 stars and 6 bars.  Thus, the number of ways is $\binom{12}{6}=\frac{12!}{6!6!}$.  Therefore, the probability is

Let $b$ = the tortoise's age.

Let $c$ = the tree's age.



When the tortoise was the tailor’s age, the tailor was only a quarter of his current age, which is $\frac{a}{4}$.  And when the tortoise was the tailor's age, the number of years younger the tailor was is the difference between the tortoise's age and the tailor's age, which is $a-(b-a)=2a-b$.  Thus, we have the equation

\[\frac{a}{4}=2a-b \implies a=8a-4b \implies 4b=7a.\]

When the tree was the tortoise’s age, the tortoise was only a seventh of its current age, which is $\frac{b}{7}$.  And when the tree was the tortoise's age, the number of years younger the tree was is the difference between the tortoise's age and the tree's age.  This is $b-(c-b)=2b-c$.  Thus, we have the equation

\[\frac{b}{7}=2b-c\implies b=14b-7c \implies 7c=13b.\]

Lastly, the sum of their ages is $264$ so we can write

\[a+b+c=264.\]

For simplicity, let $M=(a-2)(b-2)$ and $N=(c-2)(d-2)$.  If $(M,N)=(2,0)$, then $(a-2)(b-2)=2$ and $(c-2)(d-2)=0$.  The first equation gives $a$ and $b$ to be either $4$ or $3$ in some order.  This means that $ab=12$ and $a+b+c+d-3=4+c+d$, so $8=c+d$.  If $c=2$, then $d=6$, and if $d=2$, then $c=6$.  Thus, we have the quadruples \[(3,4,2,6),(4,3,2,6),(3,4,6,2),(3,4,2,6).\] Note also that setting $M=0$ and $N=2$ gives us four more triplets: \[(2,6,3,4),(2,6,4,3),(6,2,3,4),(6,2,4,3).\]

If $(M,N)=(1,1)$ then $(a-2)(b-2)=(c-2)(d-2)=1$.  Hence $(a,b)=(3,3)$ or $(a,b)=(1,1)$.  If $(a,b)=(3,3)$, then $ab=9$ and $a+b+c+d-3=3+c+d$, so $c+d=6$ and $(c,d)=(3,3)$.  If $(a,b)=(1,1)$, then $ab=1$ and $a+b+c+d-3=b+c-1$, so $b+c=2$ and $(b,c)=(1,1)$.  This gives us two more triplets: \[(1,1,1,1),(3,3,3,3).\]

Finally, if $(M,N)=(3,-1)$, then $(a-2)(b-2)=3$ and $(c-2)(d-2)=-1$.  The second equation means that either $(c,d)=(3,1)$ or $(c,d)=(1,3)$.  Either way, $cd=3$ and $a+b+c+d-3=a+b+1$, so $a+b=2$.  This can only be satisfied by $(a,b)=(1,1)$, which can not work.

Similarly, removing the second layer is plugging in $n-1$ for $n$ in the first layer expression, or $3(n^2-2n+1)+3(n-1)+1=3n^2-3n+1$.

Click to reveal hidden textPart 1:

Since each of the 3 groups (1, 5 and 50 grams) have 4 combinations (0, 1, 2 or 3 of them) we can do 4x4x4-1 which is 63. The reason you need to subtract 1 is that you can't have 0 of each.



Part 2:

Now we need to find out how many additional weights we can measure with weights on both sides of the balance.

First, we know 50s can never be on the same side as the chemicals (unless you are going to cancel it out with another 50) because 1+1+1+5+5+5 does not make 50.

I separated the values in part 2 into 4 groups: 1s and 5s, 1s and 50s, 5s and 50s, and all 3 together (1, 5, 50).

- we can measure the additional weights of 4, 9 and 14 using 1s and 5s on both sides of the scale

- we can measure the additional weights of 49, 99, 149, 48, 98, 148, 47, 97 and 147 using 1s and 50s on both sides

- we can measure the additional weights of 45, 95, 145, 40, 90, 140, 35, 85 and 135 using 5s and 50s on both sides

- we can measure 27 + 18 additional weights using 1s, 5s and 50s on both sides



The total for all four groups is 3+ 9+9+27+18=66.

Write down the four 'A's leaving some space between each of them. There are four 'A's which makes 5 spaces between them (including left of leftest A and right of rightest A). Now we look at permutations if we add in the 3 'B's- they can either be together as a clump (filling one space), or have two Bs together and one B separately (filling two spaces), or all three Bs are separate (filling three spaces). For each of these:

(i)This doesn't work because two 'C's cannot separate both the 'B's and the 'A's.

(ii)Choose 2 out of 5 spaces, ordered because one is filled by two 'B's and one is filled by only one. One of the 'C's must go between the two-B-clump and the other C can go anywhere. Note that if one of the 'B's or both the 'B' clumps are at the leftest or rightest (eg BBABAAA or BABBAAA or BAAAABB), the second 'C' cannot fill the spaces between the 'A's, so the 'B' clumps must be between the 'A's (eg ABABBAA, ABBAABA), which is choosing 2 out of 3 spaces times 2 to decide whether it's 2B-clump and 1B or 1Band 2B-clump - 6 permutations. For any of these arrangements the place of the 'C 's are set because one goes between the two 'A's and one goes between the two 'B's.

(iii)Choose 3 out of 5 spaces- we need to do more casework on this one -

(iii.1)

None of the 'B's fill the leftest/rightest spaces, so the arrangement is ""ABABABA"". In this case the two 'C's can fill any space, so choosing 2 out of 8 spaces = 28

(iii.2)

One of the leftest/rightest spaces are filled, WLOG say the left one, so for example the arrangement could be ""BAABABA"", there would be 2 (to decide whether it's leftest/rightest) * 3 (the other two 'B's can fill 2 out of 3 places between the As) = 6 ways. Then one of the 'C's go between the space left from the As  (so following the example it would be BACABABA), and then the last 'C' can go in any of 9 spaces except the two adjacent to the 'C' already there, which is 7 spaces to choose from. So 6*7=42

(iii.3)

Both the leftest and rightest spaces are filled and the third 'B' chooses 1 out of 3 spaces between the 'A's - 3 ways, and the 'C' fills up the other 2 spaces, which is 3 (BABACACAB, BACABACAB, BACACABAB)

Substitute $y=4x^2$ into $x = y^2 + e$ to obtain $x = 16x^4 + e$. We want quartic $16x^4 -x + e$ to have only one repeated real root, and thus we want it to have discriminant 0. Hopefully you remember the quartic discriminant, which for a polynomial $ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e$ is



\begin{align*}
\Delta = & \, 256a^{3}e^{3}-192a^{2}bde^{2}-128a^{2}c^{2}e^{2}+144a^{2}cd^{2}e\\[4pt]&{}-27a^{2}d^{4}+144ab^{2}ce^{2}-6ab^{2}d^{2}e-80abc^{2}de\\[4pt]&{}+18abcd^{3}+16ac^{4}e-4ac^{3}d^{2}-27b^{4}e^{2}+18b^{3}cde\\[4pt]&{}-4b^{3}d^{3}-4b^{2}c^{3}e+b^{2}c^{2}d^{2}\,.
\end{align*}

Luckily, our quartic has $b = c = d = 0$, so we focus on the terms that only involve $a$, $d$, and $e$. Thus we end up with $256a^3 e^3 - 27a^2d^4 = 0$, and plugging in $a=16$ and $d = -1$ we get $256\left(16^3\right)e^3 - 27\left(16^2\right) = 0$ which yields $e = \frac{3}{16}$. Thus, $m=3$, $n=16$, and $m + n = \boxed{19.}$



Don't remember the discriminant of a quartic? No problem! You can always derive it as the resultant of a polynomial and its derivative. For instance see pages 5 and 6 of Henry Woody's handout on polynomial resultants. Of course finding the derivative of the polynomial is, well, calculus (hence the ""No Calculus"" in quotes). But hey at least finding the derivative of a univariate polynomial will only ever involve simple applications of the power rule, so you could still call the derivation ""Minimal Calculus"" if you wanted.",False,,0,There are relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$ so that the parabola with equation $y = 4x^2$ is tangent to the parabola with equation $x = y^2 + \frac{m}{n}$ .

We can remove all occurrences of perfect squares (no explanation needed): so that $\frac{(n-3)(n-5)}{2 \cdot 3}=m^2$. We have $(n-4)^2-6m^2=1$. Solving the Pell equation, we get the minimal sol is $n-4=5$ and next minimal is $n-4=89$. The next minimal is $n-4=485 \implies n=489$.",False,,0,Find the three-digit positive integer $n$ for which $\binom n3  \binom n4 \binom n5 \binom n6 $ is a perfect square.,False
