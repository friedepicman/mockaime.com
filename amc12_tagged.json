The area of triangle ABC is 1/2 (12)(5) = 30, so the areas of triangle NBK and triangle AMJ are (64/169) (30) and (1/169)(30), respectively. Thus the area of pentagon CMJKN is (1 −  64/169 - 1/169)(30)= <math>\\boxed{\\mathbf{(D)}240/13} </math>\n\nCredit to http://billingswest.billings.k12.mt.us/math/AMC%201012/AMC%2012%20work%20sheets/2004%20AMC%2012B%20ws-15.pdf for Solution 3.\n\n===Solution 5===\nWe fake-solve. Draw a perpendicular line to side <math>CB</math> that goes through <math>N</math>. Similarly, draw a perpendicular line to side <math>AC</math> that goes through <math>M</math>. Let them intersect at <math>O</math>. It follows that quadrilateral <math>MONC</math> is a square with side <math>4</math> and thus area <math>16</math>. Now, draw a perpendicular from <math>J</math> to <math>MO</math> and let them intersect at <math>Z</math>. There is a obvious pair of congruent triangles. Fill in the gap. Hence, we see that the area of the pentagon is definitely greater than <math>16</math>. How much greater? Well, if we let the intersection of <math>AB</math> and <math>NO</math> be <math>X</math>, we can approximate that <math>\\triangle NXK</math> has an area greater than <math>2</math>. So we place bets on <math>\\boxed{\\mathbf{(D)}240/13} </math> which is correct!\n\nThis would be much easier to show and more convincing with a diagram but idk how to upload GeoGebra to AoPSwiki.\n\nSolution by franzliszt",

    "solution": "=== Solution 1 ===\nWe approach this problem by counting the number of ways ants can do their desired migration, and then multiply this number by the probability that each case occurs.\n\nLet the octahedron be <math>ABCDEF</math>, with points <math>B,C,D,E</math> [[coplanar]]. Then the ant from <math>A</math> and the ant from <math>F</math> must move to plane <math>BCDE</math>. Suppose, without loss of generality, that the ant from <math>A</math> moved to point <math>B</math>. Then, we must consider three cases.\n\n*Case 1: Ant from point <math>F</math> moved to point <math>C</math>\nOn the plane, points <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are taken. The ant that moves to <math>D</math> can come from either <math>E</math> or <math>C</math>. The ant that moves to <math>E</math> can come from either <math>B</math> or <math>D</math>. Once these two ants are fixed, the other two ants must migrate to the \"poles\" of the octahedron, points <math>A</math> and <math>F</math>. Thus, there are two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to <math>D</math>, two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to <math>E</math>, and two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to <math>A</math>. Hence, there are <math>2 \\times 2 \\times 2=8</math> ways the ants can move to different points.\n\n*Case 2: Ant from point <math>F</math> moved to point <math>D</math>\nOn the plane, points <math>B</math> and <math>D</math> are taken. The ant that moves to <math>C</math> must be from <math>B</math> or <math>D</math>, but the ant that moves to <math>E</math> must also be from <math>B</math> or <math>D</math>. The other two ants, originating from points <math>C</math> and <math>E</math>, must move to the poles. Therefore, there are two degrees of freedom in deciding which ant moves to <math>C</math> and two degrees of freedom in choosing which ant moves to <math>A</math>. Hence, there are <math>2 \\times 2=4</math> ways the ants can move to different points.\n\n*Case 3: Ant from point <math>F</math> moved to point <math>E</math>\nBy symmetry to Case 1, there are <math>8</math> ways the ants can move to different points.\n\nGiven a point <math>B</math>, there is a total of <math>8+4+8=20</math> ways the ants can move to different points. We oriented the square so that point <math>B</math> was defined as the point to which the ant from point <math>A</math> moved. Since the ant from point <math>A</math> can actually move to four different points, there is a total of <math>4 \\times 20=80</math> ways the ants can move to different points.\n\nEach ant acts independently, having four different points to choose from. Hence, each ant has probability <math>1/4</math> of moving to the desired location. Since there are six ants, the probability of each case occuring is <math>\\frac{1}{4^6} = \\frac{1}{4096}</math>. Thus, the desired answer is <math>\\frac{80}{4096}= \\boxed{\\frac{5}{256}} \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{(A)}</math>.\n\n=== Solution 2 ===\nLet <math>f(n)</math> be the number of [[cycle]]s of length <math>n</math> the can be walked among the vertices of an octahedron. For example, <math>f(3)</math> would represent the number of ways in which an ant could navigate <math>2</math> vertices and then return back to the original spot. Since an ant cannot stay still, <math>f(1) = 0</math>. We also easily see that <math>f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2</math>. \n\nNow consider any four vertices of the octahedron. All four vertices will be connected by edges except for one pair. Let’s think of this as a [[square]] with one diagonal (from top left to bottom right). EDIT: This part is wrong as if you choose the 4 vertices that have a cross section as a square, there exists no connecting diagonal.  \n<center><asy>\nsize(30);\ndefaultpen(0.6);\npair A = (0,0), B=(5,0), C=(5,5), D=(0,5);\ndraw(A--B--C--D--cycle); \ndraw(B--D);\n</asy></center>\nSuppose an ant moved across this diagonal; then the ant at the other end can only move across the diagonal (which creates 2-cycle, bad) or it can move to another vertex, but then the ant at that vertex must move to the spot of the original ant (which creates 3-cycle, bad). Thus none of the ants can navigate the diagonal and can either shift clockwise or counterclockwise, and so <math>f(4) = 2</math>.\n\nFor <math>f(6)</math>, consider an ant at the top of the octahedron. It has four choices. Afterwards, it can either travel directly to the bottom, and then it has <math>2</math> ways back up, or it can travel along the sides and then go to the bottom, of which simple counting gives us <math>6</math> ways back up. Hence, this totals <math>4 \\times (2+6) = 32</math>.\n\nNow, the number of possible ways is given by the sum of all possible cycles,\n<cmath>a \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(2) + b \\cdot f(2) \\cdot f(4) + c \\cdot f(3) \\cdot f(3) + d \\cdot f(6)</cmath>\n\nwhere the [[coefficient]]s represent the number of ways we can configure these cycles. To find <math>a</math>, fix any face, there are <math>4</math> adjacent faces to select from to complete the cycle. From the four remaining faces there are only <math>2</math> ways to create cycles, hence <math>a = 8</math>.\n\nTo find <math>b</math>, each cycle of <math>2</math> faces is distinguished by their common edge, and there are <math>12</math> edges, so <math>b = 12</math>.\n\nTo find <math>c</math>, each three-cycle is distinguished by the vertex, and there are <math>8</math> edges. However, since the two three-cycles are indistinguishable, <math>c = 8/2 = 4</math>.\n\nClearly <math>d = 1</math>. Finally,\n\n<cmath>8(1)(1)(1) + 12(1)(2) + 4(2)(2) + (32) = 80</cmath>\n\nEach bug has <math>4</math> possibilities to choose from, so the probability is <math>\\frac{80}{4^6} = \\frac{5}{256}</math>.",

So <math>a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 2}</math> and <math>a_{j + 1} > a_{j + 3}</math>.\n\nIn both cases, <math>\\max(a_j, a_{j + 1}) > \\max(a_{j + 2}, a_{j + 3})</math>, as desired.\n----------------------\n\n'''Lemma:''' If <math>a_i = a_{i + 1}</math>, then <math>a_i = 1</math>. Moreover, if instead we have <math>a_i = 0</math> for some <math>i > 2</math>, then <math>a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2} = 1</math>.\n\n'''Proof:''' By the way <math>(a_n)</math> is constructed in the problem statement, having two equal consecutive terms <math>a_i = a_{i + 1}</math> implies that <math>a_i</math> divides every term in the sequence. So <math>a_i | 999</math> and <math>a_i | a_2</math>, so <math>a_i | \\gcd(999, a_2) = 1</math>, so <math>a_i = 1</math>. For the proof of the second result, note that if <math>a_i = 0</math>, then <math>a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 2}</math>, so by the first result we just proved, <math>a_{i - 2} = a_{i - 1} = 1</math>.\n----------------------\n\n'''Lemma:''' <math>(a_n)</math> completes at <math>i</math> for some <math>i \\leq 2000</math>.\n\n'''Proof:''' Suppose <math>(a_n)</math> completed at some <math>i > 2000</math> or not at all. Then by the second lemma and the fact that neither <math>999</math> nor <math>a_2</math> are <math>0</math>, none of the pairs <math>(a_1, a_2), ..., (a_{1999}, a_{2000})</math> can have a <math>0</math> or be equal to <math>(1, 1)</math>. So the first lemma implies\n<cmath>\\max(a_1, a_2) > \\max(a_3, a_4) > \\cdots > \\max(a_{1999}, a_{2000})  > 0,</cmath>\nso <math>999 = \\max(a_1, a_2) \\geq 1000</math>, a contradiction.

We have two cases to consider.\n\n\n'''Case 1:''' If <math>a_2</math> is odd, then <math>a_3</math> is even, so <math>a_4</math> is odd, so <math>a_5</math> is odd, so <math>a_6</math> is even, and this pattern must repeat every three terms because of the recursive definition of <math>(a_n)</math>, so the terms of <math>(a_n)</math> reduced modulo 2 are\n<cmath>1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...,</cmath> \nso <math>a_{2006}</math> is odd and hence <math>1</math> (since if <math>(a_n)</math> completes at <math>i</math>, then <math>a_k</math> must be <math>0</math> or <math>1</math> for all <math>k \\geq i</math>).\n---------------------\n\n'''Case 2:''' If <math>a_2</math> is even, then <math>a_3</math> is odd, so <math>a_4</math> is odd, so <math>a_5</math> is even, so <math>a_6</math> is odd, and this pattern must repeat every three terms, so the terms of <math>(a_n)</math> reduced modulo 2 are \n<cmath>1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...,</cmath>\nso <math>a_{2006}</math> is even, and hence <math>0</math>.\n---------------------\n\n\nWe have found that <math>a_{2006} = 1</math> is true precisely when <math>\\gcd(999, a_2) = 1</math> and <math>a_2</math> is odd.

Hence the sum of digits will be at most <math>18</math>.\n\nAlso, each number with this property is divisible by <math>6</math>, therefore it is divisible by <math>3</math>, and thus also its sum of digits is divisible by <math>3</math>. Thus, the number is divisible by <math>18</math>.\n\nWe only have six possibilities left for the sum of the digits: <math>3</math>, <math>6</math>, <math>9</math>, <math>12</math>, <math>15</math>, and <math>18</math>, but since the number is divisible by <math>18</math>, the digits can only add to <math>9</math> or <math>18</math>.

This simplifies to <math>94a + 4b - 5c = 0</math>. Clearly for <math>a>0</math> there are no solutions, hence <math>a=0</math> and we get the equation <math>4b=5c</math>. This obviously has only one valid solution <math>(b,c)=(5,4)</math>, hence the only solution is the number <math>54</math>.\n\n=== Solution 3 ===\n\nThe sum of the digits is at most <math>9+9+9=27</math>. Therefore the number is at most <math>6\\cdot 27 = 162</math>. Since the number is <math>6</math> times the sum of its digits, it must be divisible by <math>6</math>, therefore also by <math>3</math>, therefore the sum of its digits must be divisible by <math>3</math>. With this in mind we can conclude that the number must be divisible by <math>18</math>, not just by <math>6</math>. Since the number is divisible by <math>18</math>, it is also divisible by <math>9</math>, therefore the sum of its digits is divisible by <math>9</math>, therefore the number is divisible by <math>54</math>, which leaves us with <math>54</math>, <math>108</math> and <math>162</math>. Only <math>54</math> is <math>6</math> times its digits, hence the answer is <math>\\boxed{1}</math>.",

Solving for <math>c</math>, we get <math>c=\\boxed{\\frac 23}</math>.  The answer is <math>\\mathrm{(C)}</math> ( what a coincidence ;) ).\n\n=== Solution 2 ===\nThe unit square is of area 1, so the five unit squares have area 5.\nTherefore the shaded space must occupy 2.5. The missing unit square is of area 1, and if reconstituted the original triangle would be of area 3.5.\nIt can then be inferred:\n<math>(3-c) * 3 = 7</math>.\n\n<math>3-c=\\frac{7}{3}</math>, so <math>3-\\frac{7}{3}=c</math>.\n\n<math>3-\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{9-7}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}</math>. <math>\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}}</math>.\n\n=== Solution 3 ===\nThe shaded space of the object can become a triangle by adding a unit square to its bottom. This triangle has a base length of <math>3-c</math> and a height of <math>3</math>. The area of this triangle region is now (using the formula <math>A=bh/2</math> for a triangle)<math>(9-3c)/2</math>. But, remember that we have to subtract the area of the extra unit square from this area to get the area of the shaded region. \n\nIf you add 3 unit squares to the top of the unshaded portion, the figure is now a right trapezoid. Using the formula for a trapezoid, you can derive that its area is <math>(9+3c)/2</math>. After you subtract the area of the 3 extra unit squares, we have derived the area of the unshaded portion.\n\nSince these areas are both equal, we set them equal to each other and solve for <math>c</math>. <math>(9-3c)/2 -1 = (9+3c)/2 -3</math>. \n<math>c</math> is now solved to be <math>\\frac{2}{3}</math>. <math>\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}}</math>.\n\n~Solution by athens2016\n\n=== Solution 4 (Brute Force) ===\nWe are looking for the area of the shaded region to be <math>\\frac 52</math>. We start by testing <math>(A) \\frac 12</math>. The area of the shaded region would be <math>\\frac{(3-\\frac 12)(3) }{2}-1=\\frac {11}{4}</math> when <math>c=\\frac 12</math>. This does not match our wanted answer.\n\nWe try <math>(B) \\frac 35</math> next. The area of the shaded region would be <math>\\frac{(3-\\frac 35)(3) }{2}-1=\\frac {13}{5}</math> when <math>c=\\frac 35</math>. This also does not match our desired answer.\n\nWe then try <math>(C) \\frac 23</math>. The area of the shaded region would be <math>\\frac{(3-\\frac 23)(3) }{2}-1=\\frac {5}{2}</math> when <math>c=\\frac 23</math>. Therefore, our answer is <math>\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C) \\frac 23}}</math>.\n\n~[https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:South South]\n\n=== Solution 5 ===\nUse the shoelace theorem to get the area of the unshaded portion in terms of a. Divide this area by the whole area which is 5. This fraction should be equal to <math>1/2</math>. You can easily solve for the answer from there.\n-mewto",

We can easily guess (or compute) the solution <math>a=10</math>, <math>b=4</math>.\n\nHence <math>180 + 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 + 4\\sqrt 5)^2</math>, and we can easily verify that also <math>180 - 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 - 4\\sqrt 5)^2</math>.\n\nWe now know the complete factorization of <math>f(x)</math>: \n\n<cmath>\nf(x) = (x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)\n</cmath>\n\nAs the final step, we can now combine the factors in a different way, in order to get rid of the square roots. \n\nWe have <math>(x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = (x-10)^2 - (4\\sqrt 5)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 20</math>,\nand <math>(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = x^2 + 20x + 20</math>.\n\nHence we obtain the factorization <math>f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)</math>.\n\nFor <math>x\\geq 20</math> both terms are positive and larger than one, hence <math>f(x)</math> is not prime.

In both cases, <math>f(x)</math> is indeed a prime, and their sum is <math>f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761 = \\boxed{802}</math>.\n\n=== Solution 3 ===\n\nInstead of doing the hard work, we can try to guess the factorization. One good approach:\n\nWe can make the observation that <math>f(x)</math> looks similar to <math>(x^2 + 20)^2</math> with the exception of the <math>x^2</math> term. In fact, we have <math>(x^2 + 20)^2 = x^4 + 40x^2 + 400</math>. But then we notice that it differs from the desired expression by a square: <math>f(x) = (x^2 + 20)^2 - 400x^2 = (x^2 + 20)^2 - (20x)^2</math>.\n\nNow we can use the formula <math>(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y)</math> to obtain the same factorization as in the previous solution, without all the work.\n\n=== Solution 4 ===\n\nAfter arriving at the factorization <math>f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)</math>, a more mathematical approach would be to realize that the second factor is always positive when <math>x</math> is a positive integer. Therefore, in order for <math>f(x)</math> to be prime, the first factor has to be <math>1</math>.\n\nWe can set it equal to 1 and solve for <math>x</math>: \n\n<math>\nx^2-20x+20=1\n</math>\n\n<math>\nx^2-20x+19=0\n</math>\n\n<math>\n(x-1)(x-19)=0\n</math>\n\n<math>\nx=1, x=19\n</math>\n\nSubstituting these values into the second factor and adding would give the answer.\n=== A way to find the desired factorization ===\nEssentially since we want to find when the function is prime, we shall attempt to factor the polynomial. Notice we have <math>(n^2+20)^2-400n^2=n^4-360n^2+400</math>, and difference of squares gives the desired factorization, and we can continue as in any other solution.

In this case, when the powerboat travels from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math>, the raft remains at <math>A</math>. Thus the trip from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> takes the same time as the trip from <math>B</math> to the raft. Since these times are equal and sum to <math>9</math> hours, the trip from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> must take half this time, or <math>4.5</math> hours. The answer is thus <math>\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}</math>.\n\nRemark: This is equivalent to viewing the problem from the raft's perspective.\n\n=== Solution 2 ===\n\nWhat's important in this problem is to consider everything in terms of the power boat and the raft, since that is how the problem is given to us. Think of the blue arrow as the power boat and the red arrow as the raft in the following three diagrams, which represent different time intervals of the problem.\n\n<asy>\nsize(8cm,8cm);\npair A, B;\nA=(-3,4);\nB=(3,4);\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\narrow((-2.5,6.4),dir(180),blue);\narrow((-2.5,6.2),dir(180),red);\npair A, B;\nA=(-3,5);\nB=(3,5);\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\narrow((2.6,5.4),dir(360),blue);\narrow((-0.5,5.2),dir(180),red);\npair A, B;\nA=(-3,6);\nB=(3,6);\ndraw(A--B);\nlabel(\"$A$\",A,S);\nlabel(\"$B$\",B,S);\narrow((.3,4.4),dir(360),blue);\narrow((1.1,4.2),dir(180),red);</asy>\n\nThinking about the distance covered as their distances with respect to each other, they are <math>0</math> distance apart in the first diagram when they haven't started to move yet, some distance <math>d</math> apart in the second diagram when the power boat reaches <math>B</math>, and again <math>0</math> distance apart in the third diagram when they meet. Therefore, with respect to each other, the boat and the raft cover a distance of <math>d</math> on the way there, and again cover a distance of <math>d</math> on when drawing closer. This makes sense, because from the 1st diagram to the second, the raft moves in the same direction as the boat, while from the 2nd to the 3rd, the boat and raft move in opposite directions.\n\nLet <math>b</math> denote the speed of the power boat (only the power boat, not factoring in current) and <math>r</math> denote the speed of the raft, which, as given by the problem, is also equal to the speed of the current. Thus, from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math>, the boat travels at a velocity of <math>b+r</math>, and on the way back, travels at a velocity of <math>-(b-r)=r-b</math>, since the current aids the boat on the way there, and goes against the boat on the way back. With respect to the raft then, the boat's velocity from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> becomes <math>(r+b)-r=b</math>, and on the way back it becomes <math>(r-b)-r=-b</math>. Since the boat's velocities with respect to the raft are exact opposites, <math>b</math> and <math>-b</math>, we therefore know that the boat and raft travel apart from each other at the same rate that they travel toward each other.\n\nFrom this, we have that the boat travels a distance <math>d</math> at rate <math>b</math> with respect to the raft both on the way to <math>B</math> and on the way back. Thus, using <math>\\dfrac{distance}{speed}=time</math>, we have <math>\\dfrac{2d}{b}=9\\text{ hours}</math>, and to see how long it took to travel half the distance, we have <math>\\dfrac{d}{b}=4.5\\text{ hours}\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}</math>\n\n=== Solution 3 ===\n\nLet <math>t</math> be the time it takes the power boat to go from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> in hours, <math>r</math> be the speed of the river current (and thus also the raft), and <math>p</math> to be the speed of the power boat with respect to the river. \n\nUsing <math>d = rt</math>, the raft covers a distance of <math>9r</math>, the distance from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> is <math>(p + r)t</math>, and the distance from <math>B</math> to where the raft and power boat met up is <math>(9 - t)(p - r)</math>. \n\nThen, <math>9r + (9 - t)(p - r) = (p + r)t</math>.

These will be all the possible <math>p_j</math>'s.\n\nFirst, there are two kinds of segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of <math>Q</math>: ''long traces'' are those connecting the midpoint of opposite sides of the same face of <math>Q</math>, and ''short traces'' are those connecting the midpoint of adjacent sides of the same face of <math>Q</math>.\n\nSuppose <math>p_j</math> contains a short trace <math>t_1</math> of a face of <math>Q</math>. Then it must also contain some trace <math>t_2</math> of an adjacent face of <math>Q</math>, where <math>t_2</math> share a common endpoint with <math>t_1</math>. So, there are three possibilities for <math>t_2</math>, each of which determines a plane <math>p_j</math> containing both <math>t_1</math> and <math>t_2</math>.\n\n'''Case 1:''' <math>t_2</math> makes an acute angle with <math>t_1</math>. In this case, <math>p_j \\cap Q</math> is an equilateral triangle made by three short traces. There are <math>8</math> of them, corresponding to the <math>8</math> vertices.\n\n'''Case 2:''' <math>t_2</math> is a long trace. <math>p \\cap Q</math> is a rectangle. Each pair of parallel faces of <math>Q</math> contributes <math>4</math> of these rectangles so there are <math>12</math> such rectangles.\n\n'''Case 3:''' <math>t_2</math> is the short trace other than the one described in case 1, i.e. <math>t_2</math> makes an obtuse angle with <math>t_1</math>. It is possible to prove that <math>p \\cap Q</math> is a regular hexagon (See note #1 for a proof) and there are <math>4</math> of them.\n\n'''Case 4:''' <math>p_j</math> contains no short traces. This can only make <math>p_j \\cap Q</math> be a square enclosed by long traces.  There are <math>3</math> such squares.\n\nIn total, there are <math>8+12+4+3=27</math> possible planes in <math>P</math>. So the maximum of <math>k</math> is <math>27</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, the most economic way to generate these long and short traces is to take all the planes in case 3 and case 4. Overall, they intersect at each trace exactly once (there is a quick way to prove this. See note #2 below.) and also covered all the <math>6\\times 4 + 4\\times 3 = 36</math> traces. So the minimum of <math>k</math> is <math>7</math>. The answer to this problem is then <math>27-7=20</math> ... <math>\\framebox{C}</math>.\n\n----\n\n'''Note 1''': Indeed, let <math>t_1=AB</math> where <math>B=t_1\\cap t_2</math>, and <math>C</math> be the other endpoint of <math>t_2</math> that is not <math>B</math>. Draw a line through <math>A</math> parallel to <math>t_1</math>. This line passes through the center <math>O</math> of the cube and therefore we see that the reflection of <math>A,B,C</math>, denoted by <math>A', B', C'</math>, respectively, lie on the same plane containing <math>A,B,C</math>. Thus <math>p_j \\cap Q</math> is the regular hexagon <math>ABCA'B'C'</math>. To count the number of these hexagons, just notice that each short trace uniquely determine a hexagon (by drawing the plane through this trace and the center), and that each face has <math>4</math> short traces. Therefore, there are <math>4</math> such hexagons.\n\n'''Note 2''': The quick way to prove the fact that none of the planes described in case 3 and case 4 share the same trace is as follows: each of these plane contains the center and therefore the intersection of each pair of them is a line through the center, which obviously does not contain any traces.",

It increases linearly with a slope of one, then when it reaches the next integer, it repeats itself. We can deduce that the function is like a sawtooth wave, with a period of one. We then analyze the function <math>f(x)=|2\\{x\\}-1|</math>. The slope of the teeth is multiplied by 2 to get 2, and the function is moved one unit downward. The function can then be described as starting at -1, moving upward with a slope of 2 to get to 1, and then repeating itself, still with a period of 1. The absolute value of the function is then taken. This results in all the negative segments becoming flipped in the Y direction. The positive slope starting at -1 of the function ranging from <math>u</math> to <math>u.5</math>, where u is any arbitrary integer, is now a negative slope starting at positive 1.   The function now looks like the letter V repeated within every square in the first row. \n\nIt is now that we address the goal of this, which is to determine how many times the function intersects the line <math>y=x</math>. Since there are two line segments per box, the function has two chances to intersect the line <math>y=x</math> for every integer. If the height of the function is higher than <math>y=x</math> for every integer on an interval, then every chance within that interval intersects the line.  \n\nReturning to analyzing the function, we note that it is multiplied by <math>x</math>, and then fed into <math>f(x)</math>. Since <math>f(x)</math> is a periodic function, we can model it as multiplying the function's frequency by <math>x</math>. This gives us <math>2x</math> chances for every integer, which is then multiplied by 2 once more to get <math>4x</math> chances for every integer.

There are 2 cases:\n\nCase 1: there are only 3 such right vertices. There are <math>\\binom{4}{3}</math> such vertices, with <math>3!</math> ways of connections to the left vertices, total arrangements are <math>\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3! = 24</math>. The fourth right vertex either has no edge to the 3 left vertices, or 1 edge to 1 of the 3 left vertices.  So there are <math>24\\cdot(1+3) = 96</math> ways.\n\nCase 2: there are 4 such right vertices, 2 of them have edges to the same pair of left vertices.  There are <math>\\binom{4}{2}</math> such vertices, with <math>3!</math> ways of connections.  So there are <math>\\binom{4}{2}\\cdot3! = 36</math> ways.\n\nTotal ways are <math>96+36=132</math>.\n\nAnother way is to overcount then subtract overlap ways.  Similar to previous case 1,  the fourth right vertex could have all possible connection to the left vertices except connecting to all 3, so it is <math>2^3-1=7</math> ways, so the total ways are <math>\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot7 = 24\\cdot7 = 168</math>.  But this overcounts the case 2 with 36 ways.  So total ways are <math>168-36=132</math>.\n\n-[https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Junche junche]\n\n===Solution 5===\n\nLet's assign to each of the 3 pairs a song that they like, and that song is disliked by the other girl(satisfy the problem's 2nd condition). The first pair has 4 choice, 2nd has 3 choice, and last one has 2 choice. <math>4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2</math>. Then the last song can be liked/disliked freely, so there is <math>2^3 = 8</math> total ways they can like/dislike the songs. Of these 8 cases, one of them is when they all like the song (which isn't allowed by the problem), so we subtract it away to have 7 cases. <math>4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 168</math>. But, we have overcounts when one pair of girls likes 2 songs, and the other girl dislikes those 2 songs. We can find the amount of cases that this happens by giving 1 pair of girls 2 songs that they like (and the other dislikes), and the other 2 pairs of girls 1 song that they like. There are 3 pairs of girls that we can choose to like 2 songs, so there are <math>3 \\cdot \\left(\\binom {4}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\\right) = 36</math> ways. <math>168 - 36 = \\boxed {\\textbf{(B) 132}}</math>.\n\n~heheman\n~Arcticturn (minor fixes in LaTeX)\n~EthanSpoon (minor fixes in LaTeX)",

If <math>n</math> is prime, then \\textit{every} <math>n</math>th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial, but since <math>n>5</math> and the degree of our polynomial is 4, this is impossible. Suppose <math>n</math> is composite. If it has a prime factor <math>p</math> greater than 5 then again every <math>p</math>th root of unity must satisfy our polynomial and we arrive at the same contradiction. Therefore suppose <math>n</math> is divisible only by 2,3,or 5. Since by hypothesis <math>z_0</math> is not a 2nd or 3rd root of unity, <math>z_0</math> must be a 5th root of unity. Since 5 is prime, every 5th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial. That is, the other 4 complex 5th roots of unity must satisfy <math>P(z_0)=0</math>. But <math>(x^5-1)/(x-1)</math> has exactly all 5th roots of unity excluding 1, and <math>(x^5-1)/(x-1)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1</math>. Thus this must divide <math>P</math> which implies <math>P(x)=4(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)</math>. This completes the proof.",

The missing number is one less than the number of hundreds <math>(k=2)</math> of <math>3600</math>, or <math>35</math>.\n\nNow consider <math>f(4)</math>. Instead of the difference between two squares needing to be <math>100</math>, the difference must now be <math>10000</math>. This first happens at <math>x\\ge 5000</math>. After this point, similarly, <math>\\sqrt{10000}=100</math> more numbers are needed to make the <math>10^4</math> th's place go up by <math>2</math>. This will take place at <math>\\left(5000+100\\right)^2=5100^2= 26010000</math>. Removing the last four digits (the zeros) and subtracting one yields <math>2600</math> for the skipped value.\n\nIn general, each new value of <math>f(k+2)</math> will add two digits to the \"<math>5</math>\" and one digit to the \"<math>1</math>\".

Removing the last <math>k</math> digits as Silvia does will be the same as removing <math>k/2</math> trailing zeroes on the number to be squared. This means that the last number on the board for <math>k=6</math> is <math>5001^2</math>, <math>k=8</math> is <math>50001^2</math>, and so on. So the first missing number is <math>5001^2-1,50001^2-1\\text{ etc.}</math> The squaring will make a \"<math>25</math>\" with two more digits than the last number, a \"<math>10</math>\" with one more digit, and a \"<math>1</math>\". The missing number is one less than that, so the \"1\" will be subtracted from <math>f(k)</math>. In other words, <math>f(k) = 25\\cdot 10^{k-2}+1\\cdot 10^{k/2}</math>.\n\nTherefore:\n\n<cmath>f(2) =35 =25 +10</cmath>\n<cmath>f(4) =2600 =2500 +100</cmath>\n<cmath>f(6) =251000 =250000 +1000</cmath>\n<cmath>f(8) = 25010000 = 25000000 + 10000</cmath>\n\nAnd so on.

When we draw these 6 complex numbers out on the complex plane, we get a crystal-looking thing. Note that the total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is <math>6^{12}</math>. Now we count the number of good combinations.\n\nWe first consider the lengths. When we multiply 12 complex numbers together, their magnitudes multiply. Suppose we have <math>n</math> of the numbers <math>\\pm \\sqrt{2}i</math>; then we must have <math>\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12-n}=1 \\Longrightarrow n=8</math>.

To find the probablilty that red goes in a higher-numbered bin than green, we can simply remove all odd-index terms (i.e term <math>1</math>, term <math>3</math>, etc.), and then sum the remaining terms - this is in fact precisely equivalent to the method of Solution 2. Writing this out as another infinite geometric sequence, we are left with <math>\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\frac{1}{64}, \\cdots</math>.

We do not consider the case where the red ball goes into bin <math>1</math> because the green ball has no where to go then. The chance that the green one is below the red one if the red one goes to bin <math>2</math> is <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math> chance that the red ball even goes in bin <math>2</math> and <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math> chance that the green ball goes into any bin less than <math>2</math>.

That means we can write another equation:\n<math>\\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{3}{128} + ...</math>\n\nSubtracting <math>\\frac{S}{4}</math> from <math>S</math>, yields:\n\n<math>S - \\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{32} + \\frac{4}{128} + ...</math>\n\nWe see that the above series is a infinite geometric sequence with common ratio <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math>. Therefore, the sum of that infinite series is <math>\\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{2}}</math>, which equals <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>.

Therefore, if we calculate the probability of the red ball and the green ball falling inside the same box, we get the answer by subtracting that probability from 1. <math>P(same) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{1}{3}</math>.

Assuming the green ball falls in bin <math>1</math>, which occurs with probability <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math>, the probability of the red ball falling in a bin higher is also <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math>, as it needs to fall anywhere but the first box, which happens with probability <math>1 - \\frac{1}{2}</math>. Assuming that instead the green ball falls in the second bin, which occurs with probability <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>, we can see that the probability of the red ball being higher is also <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>, as it needs to fall anywhere but the first two, which happens with probability <math>1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}</math>. This pattern continues, meaning the probability of red being in a box higher than green is <math>\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{8} + \\ldots = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\ldots = x</math>.

By replacing the sum inside with <math>x</math> as they are equivalent, we get <math>\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1+x\\right) = x</math>, which gets us <math>x = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}</math>\n\n~AmyInRetrograde",

In essence, for a solution <math>z</math> to <math>z\\overline z=1</math>, then any integer power of <math>z</math> is also a solution. This is particularly useful in this problem: we are given that <math>n=1\\implies q=3</math> and <math>k=1</math> is a solution, so <math>z=3-2\\sqrt2</math>.

However, it does provide a good estimate for the approximate answer as on average, the number of arrangements will be almost the same when each container has an odd # of balls or when each container has an even # of balls. (similar binomial distributions)\n\n\nThe above clarification is a good explanation of why the stars and bars argument still yields an expression sufficiently closed to <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>. However, I think the content of this clarification should be clearly explained WITHIN any stars and bars solution. Even with this clarification, this page is currently a redundant mess of poorly explained fakesolves:\n\nSolutions 1 and 2 both use stars and bars to arrive at an incorrect probability and fail to explain why their method is a good approximation of the actual probability.\n\nThe explanation in solution 4 does not make sense at all.\n\nThe nature of this problem makes it so that pretty much any approach will arrive at an answer close to <math>\\frac{1}{4}</math>. However, I'm concerned that the current state of this page will make most readers come away with a worsened understanding of the structure of the problem, especially since the first two solutions are both fakesolves. This page should be fixed ASAP.\n\nPlease don't delete this message without addressing any of my concerns. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. ~ CT17\n\n(Solution 5 by Dissmo does a very good job at explaining Solution 4.)\n-Multpi12\n\nIs the reason why the answers aren't exact because the bins are not distinct? Is it because of the situations where some bins have the same number of balls? \n~ Bread10\n\nThe reason why solutions using stars and bars are not exact is because they make incorrect assumptions about the probability space. In the stars and bars solution, the sample space is the set of all orderings <math>(x_1, x_2, x_3)</math> such that <math>x_1, x_2, x_3</math> are nonnegative integers satisfying <math>x_1+x_2+x_3=2023</math>. However, not every element in this sample space is equally likely, so one cannot calculate probability by simply dividing the # of favorable outcomes over the # of total outcomes (# of elements in the sample space).  ~tsun26\n\nYeah Bread10 here's an example: Say we were counting the number of ways to put 6 objects into 3 bins. Stars and Bars tells us there are <math>\\binom{8}{2}</math> ways for this to happen, which is perfectly fine and accurate for counting. However, for probabilities, it treats all arrangements as being equally likely to happen. So using Stars and Bars for probabilities would mean having 2 objects per bin is just as likely as having 3 objects in one bin, 2 in another, and 1 in the leftover bin, when in reality, the <math>3-2-1</math> case is more likely to happen because there are <math>6</math> different ways to permute the number of objects in the bins (3-2-1, 3-1-2, 1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-1-3, 2-3-1) versus only one way for the <math>2</math> objects per bin case (2-2-2). \n\n~[https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:grogg007 grogg007]",

    "solution": "We start by trying to prove a function of <math>n</math>, and then we can apply the function and equate it to <math>936</math> to find the value of <math>n</math>.\n\nIt is helpful to think of this problem in the format <math>(1+2+3+4+5+6) \\cdot (1+2+3+4+5+6) \\dots</math>. Note that if we represent the scenario in this manner, we can think of picking a <math>1</math> for one factor and then a <math>5</math> for another factor to form their product - this is similar thinking to when we have the factorized form of a polynomial. Unfortunately this is not quite accurate to the problem because we can reach the same product in many ways: for example for <math>n=2</math>, <math>4</math> can be reached by picking <math>1</math> and <math>4</math> or <math>2</math> and <math>2</math>. However, this form gives us insights that will be useful later in the problem.\n\nNote that there are only <math>3</math> primes in the set <math>\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}</math>: <math>2,3,</math> and <math>5</math>. Thus if we're forming the product of possible values of a dice roll, the product has to be written in the form <math>2^h \\cdot 3^i \\cdot 5^j</math> (the choice of variables will become clear later), for integer nonnegative values <math>h,i,j</math>. So now the problem boils down to how many distinct triplets <math>(h,i,j)</math> can be formed by taking the product of <math>n</math> dice values. \n\nWe start our work on representing <math>j</math>: the powers of <math>5</math>, because it is the simplest in this scenario because there is only one factor of <math>5</math> in the set. Because of this, having <math>j</math> fives in our prime factorization of the product is equivalent to picking <math>j</math> factors from the polynomial <math>(1+\\dots + 6) \\cdots</math> and choosing each factor to be a <math>5</math>. Now that we've selected <math>j</math> factors, there are <math>n-j</math> factors remaining to choose our powers of <math>3</math> and <math>2</math>. \n\nSuppose our prime factorization of this product contains <math>i</math> powers of <math>3</math>. These powers of <math>3</math> can either come from a <math>3</math> factor or a <math>6</math> factor, but since both <math>3</math> and <math>6</math> contain only one power of <math>3</math>, this means that a product with <math>i</math> powers of <math>3</math> corresponds directly to picking <math>i</math> factors from the polynomial, each of which is either <math>3</math> or <math>6</math> (but this distinction doesn't matter when we consider only the powers of <math>3</math>. \n\nNow we can reframe the problem again. Our method will be as follows: Suppose we choose an arbitrary pair <math>(i,j)</math> that match the requirements, corresponding to the number of <math>3</math>'s and the number of <math>5</math>'s our product will have. Then how many different <math>h</math> values for the powers of <math>2</math> are possible?\n\nIn the <math>i+j</math> factors we have already chosen, we obviously can't have any factors of <math>2</math> in the <math>j</math> factors with <math>5</math>. However, we can have a factor of <math>2</math> pairing with factors of <math>3</math>, if we choose a <math>6</math>. The maximal possible power of <math>2</math> in these <math>i</math> factors is thus <math>2^i</math>, which occurs when we pick every factor to be <math>6</math>. \n\nWe now have <math>n-i-j</math> factors remaining, and we want to allocate these to solely powers of <math>2</math>. For each of these factors, we can choose either a <math>1,2,</math> or <math>4</math>. Therefore the maximal power of <math>2</math> achieved in these factors is when we pick <math>4</math> for all of them, which is equivalent to <math>2^{2\\cdot (n-i-j)}</math>.\n\nNow if we multiply this across the total <math>n</math> factors (or <math>n</math> dice) we have a total of <math>2^{2n-2i-2j} \\cdot 2^i = 2^{2n-i-2j}</math>, which is the maximal power of <math>2</math> attainable in the product for a pair <math>(i,j)</math>. Now note that every power of <math>2</math> below this power is attainable: we can simply just take away a power of <math>2</math> from an existing factor by dividing by <math>2</math>. Therefore the powers of <math>2</math>, and thus the <math>h</math> value ranges from <math>h=0</math> to <math>h=2n-i-2j</math>, so there are a total of <math>2n+1-i-2j</math> distinct values for <math>h</math> for a given pair <math>(i,j)</math>. \n\nNow to find the total number of distinct triplets, we must sum this across all possible <math>i</math>s and <math>j</math>s. Lets take note of our restrictions on <math>i,j</math>: the only restriction is that <math>i+j \\leq n</math>, since we're picking factors from <math>n</math> dice.\n\n<cmath> \\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} 2n+1 - \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j</cmath>\n\nWe start by calculating the first term. <math>2n+1</math> is constant, so we just need to find out how many pairs there are such that <math>i+j \\leq n</math>. Set <math>i</math> to <math>0</math>: <math>j</math> can range from <math>0</math> to <math>n</math>, then set <math>i</math> to <math>1</math>: <math>j</math> can range from <math>0</math> to <math>n-1</math>, etc. The total number of pairs is thus <math>n+1+n+n-1+\\dots+1 = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</math>. Therefore the left summation evaluates to <cmath>\\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</cmath>\n\nNow we calculate <math>\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j</math>. This simplifies to <math>\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i + 2 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} j</math>. Note that because <math>i+j = n</math> is symmetric with respect to <math>i,j</math>, the sum of <math>i</math> in all of the pairs will be equal to the sum of <math>j</math> in all of the pairs. Thus this is equal to calculating <math>3 \\cdot \\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i</math>.\n\nIn the pairs, <math>i=1</math> appears for <math>j</math> ranging between <math>0</math> and <math>n-1</math> so the sum here is <math>1 \\cdot (n)</math>. Similarly <math>i=2</math> appears for <math>j</math> ranging from <math>0</math> to <math>n-2</math>, so the sum is <math>2 \\cdot (n-1)</math>. If we continue the pattern, the sum overall is <math>(n)+2 \\cdot (n-1) + 3 \\cdot (n-2) + \\dots + (n) \\cdot 1</math>. We can rearrange this as <math>((n)+(n-1)+ \\dots + 1) + ((n-1)+(n-2)+ \\dots + 1)+ ((n-2)+(n-3)+ \\dots + 1) + \\dots + 1)</math>\n\n<cmath> = \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}+ \\dots + 1</cmath>\n\nWe can write this in easier terms as <math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{(k)(k+1)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2+k</math>\n<cmath>=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k^2 + \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k)</cmath>\n<cmath>= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{(n)(n+1)}{2})</cmath>\n<cmath>= \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot ( \\frac{(n)(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + \\frac{3n(n+1)}{6}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+4)}{6}</cmath>\n<cmath> = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}</cmath>\n\nWe multiply this by <math>3</math> to obtain that <cmath>\\sum_{i+j \\leq n}^{} i+2j = \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</cmath>\n\nThus our final answer for the number of distinct triplets <math>(h,i,j)</math> is:\n<cmath>\\sum_{i+j\\leq n}^{} 2n+1-i-2j = \\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)(n+2)}{2} - \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{2}</cmath>\n<cmath> = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (2n+1-n) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2} \\cdot (n+1)</cmath>\n<cmath> = \\frac{(n+1)^2(n+2)}{2}</cmath>\n\nNow most of the work is done. We set this equal to <math>936</math> and prime factorize. <math>936 = 12 \\cdot 78 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13</math>, so <math>(n+1)^2(n+2) = 936 \\cdot 2 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 13</math>. Clearly <math>13</math> cannot be anything squared and <math>2^4 \\cdot 3^2</math> is a perfect square, so <math>n+2 = 13</math> and <math>n = 11 = \\boxed{A}</math>\n\n\n\n~KingRavi",

Long story short, one finds the solutions to be\n<cmath>(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1)\\cdots (0, 0, 6)</cmath>\n<cmath>(0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0)\\cdots (0, 6, 0)</cmath>\n<cmath>(1, 5, 0), (1, 0, 5), (1, 2, 1), (1, 1, 2)</cmath>\n<cmath>(2, 4, 0), (2, 0, 4) (2, 2, 1), (2, 1, 2)</cmath>\n<cmath>(3, 3, 0), (3, 0, 3)</cmath>\n<cmath>(4, 2, 0), (4, 0, 2)</cmath>\n<cmath>(5, 1, 0), (5, 0, 1)</cmath>\n<cmath>(6, 0, 0)</cmath>\n\nThere are little tricks we can use to make the process of adding up the corresponding outcomes faster. First, we notice that the first, second, and last row of solutions contributes <math>2^7=128</math> outcomes. Then we can take advantage of the symmetry between <math>x, y</math> to add up the rest of the outcomes. In the end we get\n<cmath>128+2(6+180+15+180+20+15+6)=972</cmath>\n\nHence, the probability is <math>\\frac{972}{4^6}=\\frac{243}{2^{10}}</math>. Therefore, the answer is <math>\\fbox{\\textbf{(A) } 243}</math>\n\n~tsun26",
