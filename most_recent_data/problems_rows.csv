 $$
x=\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{4}{2^2}+\dfrac{9}{2^3}+\dfrac{16}{2^4}+ \cdots \quad (1)

 We can start by multiplying $(1)$ by $\dfrac{1}{2}$ giving us 
 $$\dfrac{1}{2}x=\dfrac{1}{2^2}+\dfrac{4}{2^3}+\dfrac{9}{2^4}+\dfrac{16}{2^5} \cdots \quad (2)$$ 
 $(1) (2)$ gets us

 $$\dfrac{1}{4}x=\dfrac{1}{2^2}+\dfrac{3}{2^3}+\dfrac{5}{2^4}+\dfrac{7}{2^5}+ \cdots \quad (4)$$

 $$\dfrac{1}{4}x=\dfrac{1}{2}+(\dfrac{1}{2}+\dfrac{1}{2^2}+\dfrac{1}{2^3}+ )$$

 Proof We proceed by induction $\underline{\text{Base Case }}$ We have 
 \begin{align*}
(g_0 g_1 g_2) \equiv (1 2 3) \pmod{5}
&\implies g_3 \equiv 3\cdot1+2\cdot2+3\cdot1 \equiv 3+4+3 \equiv 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_4 \equiv 1\cdot0+2\cdot3+3\cdot2 \equiv 0+6+6\equiv 12 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_5 \equiv 1\cdot2+2\cdot0+3\cdot3 \equiv 2+0+9 \equiv 11 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_6 \equiv 1\cdot1+2\cdot2+3\cdot0 \equiv 1+4+0 \equiv 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_7\equiv 1\cdot0+2\cdot1+3\cdot2 \equiv 0+2+6\equiv8\equiv 3\pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_8 \equiv 1\cdot3+2\cdot0+3\cdot1\equiv 3+0+3\equiv 6 \equiv 1 \equiv g_0 \pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_9 \equiv 1\cdot1+2\cdot3+3\cdot0 \equiv 1+6+0\equiv 7 \equiv 2 \equiv g_1 \pmod{5} \\
&\implies g_{10} \equiv 1 \cdot 2 + 2\cdot1+3\cdot3\equiv 2+2+9\equiv 13 \equiv 3 \equiv g_2 \pmod{5} \end{align*} so the desired result holds for $n=0 1 2 $ 
 
 $\underline{\text{Inductive Assumption }}$ Assume that the desired result holds for some $n=k k+1 k+2 $ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq0} $ 
 
 $\underline{\text{Inductive Step }}$ We have 
 \begin{align*}
g_{(k+3)+8} &\equiv g_{k+11} \\
&\equiv g_{k+10}+g_{k+9}+g_{k+8} \\
&\equiv g_{k+2}+g_{k+1}+g_{k} \\
&\equiv g_{k+3} \end{align*} completing the inductive step Hence by the Principle of Mathematical Induction we have proven the desired result $\blacksquare$

 Vertical line 
 A vertical line $\ell$ through $\triangle\mathit{ABC}$ partitions the region bound by it into another right triangle and a right trapezoid enclosing regions of the same area If $\ell$ intersects $\overline{\mathit{AB}}$ at $(x 0)$ the area of the smaller right triangle is $(2/3)x^{2}$ and since the height of the right trapezoid is $3 x$ the area of it is 
 $$ \frac{2}{3}\Bigl(x^{2} 9\Bigr) $$ The only positive solution to

 $$3y \frac{3}{8} \ y^{2} $$ The only two solutions to the quadratic equation 
 $$\frac{3}{8}\Bigl(y 4\Bigr)^{2} = 3y \frac{3}{8} \ y^{2}$$ are $4 2\sqrt{2}$ and $4 + 2\sqrt{2}$ Since $y < 4$ $4 + 2\sqrt{2}$ is an extraneous solution Line parallel to hypotenuse

 Now note that the expression is equivalent to $3\left(x+\frac{1}{x} \right)$ It is known that this is increasing over the interval $(1 \infty)$ Since the equation is the same when $x=\frac{1}{x}$ the maximum occurs when $x=\frac{3}{2}$ This gives the maximum as $\frac{13}{2}$ Thus the requested range is $$\boxed{[6 6 5]}$$",true,false,0,"Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $BC = 5$, $CA = 3$, and $AB = 4$.

 The equation $x^2+xy+y^2=64$ can be viewed using Law of Cosines as a triangle with sides $x y 8$ with $120^{\circ}$ being the angle between sides $x$ and $y $ We can do the same thing for the rest to create 3 triangles and join them at the center (three 120 degree angles) to get one big triangle (image) with side lengths $8 7 \sqrt{57} $ If we let $a$ be the angle between the sides of length $8$ and $7 $ then from LoC $$8^2+7^2 2(8)(7)(\cos{a})=57 $$ so $\cos{a}=\frac{1}{2}$ and $a=60^{\circ}$ Then by calculating the area using LoS one way as a sum of the three triangle areas and another using the whole triangle we have $$\frac{1}{2}(8)(7)(\sin{60})=14\sqrt{3}=\frac{1}{2}(\sin{120})(xy+yz+xz)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}(xy+yz+xz) $$ so $xy+yz+xz=56 $ 
 
 If we add the 3 equations up and factoring we have $$2(x+y+z)^2 3(xy+yz+xz)=64+49+57=170 \Rightarrow 2(x+y+z)^2=170+3(56) \Rightarrow x+y+z=13 $$ Also by adding them up we have $$2(x^2+y^2+z^2)+(xy+yz+xz)=170 \Rightarrow 2(x^2+y^2+z^2)=170 56 \Rightarrow x^2+y^2+z^2=57 $$ Subtracting $z^2+zx+x^2=57$ from $x^2+y^2+z^2=57 $ we get $y^2=zx $ and so what we're looking for $\sqrt[3]{xyz}$ is just $\sqrt[3]{(xz)(y)}=\sqrt[3]{(y^2)(y)}=y $ 
 From the third equation we have $z^2+zx+x^2=(z+x)^2 xz=57 $ and as we know $x+y+z=13$ and $y^2=xz $ this becomes $$(13 y)^2 y^2=169 26y+y^2 y^2=57 \Rightarrow y=\frac{56}{13} $$ Thus our answer is $\fbox{69} $",true,false,0,"Suppose that $x, y$, and $z$ are positive real numbers satisfying $$\begin{cases} x^2 + xy + y^2 = 64 \\ y^2 + yz + z^2 = 49 \\ z^2 + zx + x^2 = 57 \end{cases}$$Then $\sqrt[3]{xyz}$ can be expressed as $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

They are then given a score equal to the number of outs they throw as a pitcher plus the number of hits they get as a batter. What is the highest score received?",false

Let $ x $ be the expected number of additional tosses you must make before you get $ 60 $ consecutive heads. Find the sum of all distinct prime factors in $ x $.,4.5,BMT 2012 Individual Round #8,https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c521h510744p2867537,65821,821,2012,Spring Round (2012) #8,positive integer > 1000,"Answer 65821 
 
 Solution Let $E_n$ be the expected number of flips to get 60 consecutive heads if you have already had $n$ consectuvive heads in the current run Here run means a series of uninterupted heads Then we have the following recurrence \[E_n = 1+\frac{1}{2}*(E_{n+1}+E_0)\] 
 What this is saying is that if you have $n$ consecutive heads then on your next flip you have an even chance of either getting heads and having $n+1$ consecuitve heads or getting tails and resetting back to zero Now we know that $E_{60}=0$ so then we have 
 \[E_{60 t}=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^{t 1}{\frac{1}{2}^i}+E_0\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^{t}{\frac{1}{2}^i}\] 
 Plugging in $t=60$ and solving for $E_0$ we get \[E_0=2*(2^{60} 1)\] 
 Now $28=60 32$ thus 
 \[E_{28}=E_{60 32}=\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^{31}{\frac{1}{2}^i}+2*(2^{60} 1)\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=1}^{32}{\frac{1}{2}^i}\] 
 Simplifying we get 
 \[E_{28}=2^{59}*(2^{32} 1)\] 
 So we have $2$ as a prime divisor so to get the remaining prime divisors we need to find the prime divisors of 
 $2^{32} 1$ 
 \[2^{32} 1=(2^{16}+1)(2^{8}+1)(2^{4} 1)(2^{4}+1)=65537*257*15*17\] 
 so from $15$ and $17$ we get $3 5 17$ as prime divisors Now we just need to find the prime divisors of $65537$ and $257$ 
 $17^2=289>257$ so any prime divisor of $257$ must be less than $17$ this leaves $2 3 5 7 11 13$ which can all be checked easily by hand to deterime that $257$ is prime As for $65537$ I had a hunch that it was prime but could not find a nice shortcut to prove it so I wound up doing the rather tedious task of testing all primes less than $\sqrt{65537}$ to determine that it is indeed prime Thus the solutions is $2+3+5+17+257+65537=65281$",true,false,0,You are tossing an unbiased coin.

 $\phi^2(13^r)=\phi(13^{r 1}12)=\phi(13^{r 1})\phi(12)=13^{r 2}\cdot12\cdot4=13^{r 2}2^43$ 
 $\phi^3(13^r)=\phi(13^{r 2}48)=13^{r 3}2^63$ 
 We notice a pattern that $\phi^k(13^r)=13^{r k}2^{2k}3$ 
 
 Proof Let $P(k)=\phi^k(13^r)=13^{r k}2^{2k}3$ 
 $P(1)$ is true Let $P(k)$ be true $\phi^{k+1}(13^r)=\phi(\phi^k(13^r))$ 
 $=\phi(13^{r k}2^{2k}3)=13^{r k 1}2^{2k+2}3=13^{r (k+1)}2^{2(k+1)}3=P(k+1)$ 
 Hence claim is true Now at $k=r \phi^r(13^r)=2^{2k}3$ 
 $\phi^{r+q}(13^r)=\phi^q(\phi^r(13^r))=\phi^q(2^{2r}3)$ 
 $\phi(2^{2r}3)=2^{2r}$ 
 $\phi(2^{2r})=2^{2r 1}\implies \phi^{q}(2^{2r}3)=\phi^{q 1}(\phi(2^{2r}3))=\phi^{q 1}(2^{2r})=2^{2r q+1}$ 
 
 Finally we have $\phi^{q+r}(13^r)=2^{2r+1 q}$ 
 As we want $\phi^{\theta}(13^r)=\phi^{r+q}(13^r)=2^{2r+1 q}=1$ 
 We have $q=2r+1=2(2012)+1=4025$ 
 $f(2012)=\theta(13^{2012})=q+r=2012+4025=\boxed{6037}$",true,false,0,"Let $\phi$ be the Euler totient function.

 Now note that square $(a d)$ is in the same column as $(a b) $ so if we let $x$ be the number in that square we have $x>s_1 $ This implies that $x>s_2 $ However this is a contradiction because $(a d)$ is also in the same row as $(c d) $ so $s_2$ is not the largest number in its row contradiction Hence there can be at most one saddle point in a $3 \times 3$ grid $\blacksquare$

 First note that $g(1)$ is also $16 $ so it follows that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ must be tangent Then if we decrease $c$ while keeping the graph of $f(x)$ tangent to the graph of $g(x) $ at some point the graph of $f(x)$ will intersect the graph of $h(x) $ Therefore by continuity the graph of $f(x)$ must have been tangent to $h(x)$ at some point Hence since the value of $c$ was decreasing the whole time it follows that $c$ is minimized when $f(x)$ is tangent to both $g(x)$ and $h(x) $

 Firstly since the circle is tangent to $\overline{AB}$ at $E $ it follows that $\angle{OEA}=90^\circ $ so it follows that $\angle{OFD}=90^\circ$ as well Since $D$ and $E$ are on the circle we have $$OE = OD = \frac{32}{49} $$ and we also have 
 \begin{align*}
OF &= EF EO \\
&= 1 \frac{32}{49} \\
&= \frac{17}{49} \end{align*} Hence by the Pythagorean Theorem we get 
 \begin{align*}
DF &= \sqrt{OD^2 OF^2} \\
&= \sqrt{\left(\frac{32}{49}\right)^2 \left(\frac{17}{49}\right)^2} \\
&= \frac{\sqrt{32^2 17^2}}{49} \\

 Note that the problem condition implies that each honest buck has at least $3$ dishonest buck neighbors and each dishonest buck has at least $2$ honest buck neighbors If we let $H$ be the number of honest bucks then there are at least $3H$ buckaroo pairs by looking at the honest bucks and at least $2(10^6 H)$ buckaroo pairs by looking at the dishonest bucks Thus we wish to minimize $\max(3H 2(10^6 H))$ By inspection this happens when the two expressions are equal or when $H=\dfrac{2(10^6)}{5}$ (as when $H$ decreases from this value $2(10^6 H)$ increases and when $H$ increases from this value $3H$ increases which increases the maximum in both cases) This gives us a lower bound of $3H = \dfrac{6(10^6)}{5} = 1200000$ pairs To achieve the minimum notice that we are forced to have every honest buck have exactly one honest buck neighbor and every dishonest buck have exactly two dishonest buck neighbors This means that for every buck the number of honest bucks out of the set of $5$ bucks including itself and its four neighbors is $2$ This is now equivalent to saying that we want to choose $\dfrac{2(10^6)}{5}$ cells in this grid such that for every cell $(x y)$ exactly two of $\{(x y) (x 1 y) (x+1 y) (x y 1) (x y+1)\}$ are chosen Now motivated by Putnam 2019 B6 we consider the set of cells $$S = \{(x y) \mid x+2y\equiv 0\text{ or }1 \pmod{5}\} $$ Since the number of cells in each row and in each column is divisible by $5$ we do not encounter any issues with when the coordinates wrap around Thus for each cell $(x y)$ notice that the map sending $(x y)\mapsto x+2y$ sends the set $$\{(x y) (x 1 y) (x+1 y) (x y 1) (x y+1)\}$$ to the set $$\{x+2y x+2y 1 x+2y+1 x+2y 2 x+2y+2\}$$ which when taken mod $5$ constitutes a complete residue system mod $5$ (as this is a set of $5$ consecutive integers) This means that exactly one of them is $0\pmod{5}$ and exactly one of the other ones is $1\pmod{5}$ Thus exactly two of the cells are in $S$ 
 
 We now make every buck in a cell in $S$ an honest buck and every other buck a dishonest buck This suffices we proved above that every cell $(x y)$ has exactly two of $\{(x y) (x 1 y) (x+1 y) (x y 1) (x y+1)\}$ in $S$ so for every buck the number of honest bucks out of the set of $5$ bucks including itself and its four neighbors is $2$ This gives every honest buck exactly one neighboring honest buck and every dishonest buck exactly two neighboring honest bucks satisfying the conditions This also means that by looking at the honest bucks there are $3\left(\dfrac{2(10^6)}{5}\right) = 1200000$ buckaroo pairs in this configuration as desired Thus the minimum is $\boxed{1200000}$ 
 
 This can be easily generalized using the Putnam problem if this somehow translated to $N$ dimensions and the grid was $a_1\times \dots\times a_N$ with $(2N+1)$ dividing $a_i$ for all $i$ and every buck said ""at most $K$ of my neighboring bucks are honest bucks"" the minimum should turn out to be $\dfrac{(2N K)(K+1)a_1\dots a_N}{2N+1}$",true,false,0,"One million bucks (i.e. one million male deer) are in different cells of a $1000 \times 1000$ grid.

 \[\dfrac{\delta(I BC)}{\delta(A BC)} = \dfrac{a}{a + b + c} \] 
 Proof Let $\delta(X YZ)$ denote the distance from point $X$ to $YZ$ Consider the incenter $I$ of triangle $ABC$ Note that $ABC$ and $IBC$ share a common base $BC$ so $\dfrac{\delta(I BC)}{\delta(A BC)} = \dfrac{[IBC]}{[ABC]}$ If $r$ is the inradius then $[IBC] = \dfrac{1}{2}ar$ We also know that $[ABC] = rs = \dfrac{1}{2}r(a + b + c)$ Dividing these gives 
 \[\dfrac{\delta(I BC)}{\delta(A BC)} = \dfrac{[IBC]}{[ABC]} = \dfrac{\frac{1}{2}ar}{\frac{1}{2}r(a + b + c)} = \dfrac{a}{a + b + c}\] 
 
 
 Let the ratio of similarity(?) of $CAB$ to $CMN$ be $r$ Then we know that $r(a + b + 36) =48$ However by Lemma 1 \[r = \dfrac{\delta(C MN)}{\delta(C AB)} = 1 \dfrac{\delta(I AB)}{\delta(C AB)} = 1 \dfrac{36}{a + b + 36} = \dfrac{a + b}{a + b + 36} \] Substituting this in we have 
 \[\dfrac{a + b}{a + b + 36}\cdot(a + b + 36) = a + b = 48 \] Squaring gives $a^2 + b^2 + 2ab = 48^2$ By the Pythagorean Theorem on the larger right triangle we know that $a^2 + b^2 = 36^2$ Subtracting gives

 hint1 The number of functions with $f^{101}(1)=2$ should be the same as the number of functions with $f^{101}(1)=3$ as you can just flip every 2 with a 3 in the function right? 
 hint2 Once you find an expression for N you need to find it mod 103 Use Fermat's little theorem and Wilson's theorem to help you and you may want to see this https //en wikipedia org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse 
 my solution Note that 2 is not different from 3 4 101 in the purpose of solving this problem Therefore if we can find the number of functions such that $f^{101}(1)=1$ we can find the answer Now since 101 is a prime either $f(1)=1$ or f makes a big loop crossing every number ( $e g f(1)=2 f(2)=3 f(100)=101 f(101)=1$ ) 
 For the first case there are $101^{100}$ ways of making the number for the second case there are $100!$ ways of finding the numbers The number of functions with $f^{101}(1)=1$ is $101^{100}+100!$ 
 The number of functions with $f^{101}(1)=2$ is $\frac{101^{101} 101^{100} 100!}{100}$ which is $101^{100} 99!$ 
 Since we know that $101^{102}\equiv 1 (\mod 103)$ so $101^{100} \mod 103$ can be fairly easily calculated Since we know that $102!\equiv 1(\mod 103)$ $99! \mod 103$ can be fairly easily calculated The way you calculate the modulo is that you can find the reciprocal of $101^2$ and $100*101*102$ using extended Euclidean algorithm The reciprocal of $101^2 \equiv 4$ is 26 the reciprocal of $100*101*101 \equiv 6$ is 17 In the end the result comes to be $26 ( 17)\equiv \boxed{43}$",true,false,0,"Let $N$ be the number of functions $f$ from $\{1, 2, \dots, 101 \} \rightarrow \{1, 2, \dots, 101 \}$ such that $f^{101}(1) = 2.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $103.$",false

A plane in $3$-dimensional space passes through the point $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$, with $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ all positive. The plane also intersects all three coordinate axes with intercepts greater than zero (i.e. there exist positive numbers $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$ such that $(b_1, 0, 0)$, $(0, b_2, 0)$, and $(0, 0, b_3)$ all lie on this plane). Find, in terms of $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, the minimum possible volume of the tetrahedron formed by the origin and these three intercepts. p8. The left end of a rubber band e meters long is attached to a wall and a slightly sadistic child holds on to the right end. A point-sized ant is located at the left end of the rubber band at time $t = 0$, when it begins walking to the right along the rubber band as the child begins stretching it. The increasingly tired ant walks at a rate of $1/(ln(t + e))$ centimeters per second, while the child uniformly stretches the rubber band at a rate of one meter per second. The rubber band is infinitely stretchable and the ant and child are immortal. Compute the time in seconds, if it exists, at which the ant reaches the right end of the rubber band. If the ant never reaches the right end, answer $+\infty$. p9. We say that two lattice points are neighboring if the distance between them is $1$. We say that a point lies at distance d from a line segment if $d$ is the minimum distance between the point and any point on the line segment. Finally, we say that a lattice point $A$ is nearby a line segment if the distance between $A$ and the line segment is no greater than the distance between the line segment and any neighbor of $A$. Find the number of lattice points that are nearby the line segment connecting the origin and the point $(1984, 2012)$. p10.

Sean thinks packing is hard, so he decides to do math instead. He has a rectangular sheet that he wants to fold so that it fits in a given rectangular box. He is curious to know what the optimal size of a rectangular sheet is so that it’s expected to fit well in any given box. Let a and b be positive reals with $a \le b$, and let $m$ and $n$ be independently and uniformly distributed random variables in the interval $(0, a)$. For the ordered $4$-tuple $(a, b, m, n)$, let $f(a, b, m, n)$ denote the ratio between the area of a sheet with dimension a×b and the area of the horizontal cross-section of the box with dimension $m \times n$ after the sheet has been folded in halves along each dimension until it occupies the largest possible area that will still fit in the box (because Sean is picky, the sheet must be placed with sides parallel to the box’s sides). Compute the smallest value of b/a that maximizes the expectation $f$. PS. You had better use hide for answers.",false

 \[ (2010x 4)(x^2 1)(x^2 2)(x^2 3)(x^2 4) P(x)=0 \] 
 
 We immediately see that this is now a ninth degree polynomial with a leading coefficient of $ 2010 $ Now if we can find the coefficient of $ x^9 $ we can use Vieta to find the sum of the roots We now see that the only way to obtain an $ x^9 $ is by taking a $ 4 $ from $ (2010x 4) $ then each $ x^2 $ from the four other factors so the coefficient of $ x^9 $ is $ 4 $ and so by Vieta the sum of the roots is $ \frac{ 4}{2010}=\boxed{\frac{2}{1005}} $ 
 
 There's a small hole in this solution This solution assumes that none of the roots are extraneous that is none of the roots cause any of the denominators to be $ 0 $ To show that none of the roots are extraneous we rewrite $ P(x) $ as 
 \[ (x^2 2)(x^2 3)(x^2 4)+2(x^2 1)(x^2 3)(x^2 4)+3(x^2 1)(x^2 2)(x^2 4)+4(x^2 1)(x^2 2)(x^2 3) \]

 This is an arithmetic series We have

 for some $ x $ The reason that the sum is $ \le 2010 $ and not exactly equal is because it's possible that we won't get a complete block of twos to make it sum to $ 2010 $ and so we're trying to find the number of complete blocks less than that then we can count the number of twos after it later Using the formula for an arithmetic series we have $ \frac{(x 1)(x+3)}{4}\le2010 $ Testing odd values of $ x $ we see that the greatest possible $ x $ is $ 87 $ making that fraction equal to $ 1935 $ This means that there are $ 43 $ terms in the sequence Thus for $ 43 $ pairs of parentheses we have $ (1+2)+(1+2+2)+(1+2+2+2)+\cdots+(1+2+2+\cdots+2)=1935 $

 One property of modular arithmetic is that $ an\equiv bn(\bmod cn)\implies a\equiv b(\bmod c) $ and so we can reduce this again to $ 3x\equiv2(\bmod 5) $ Now since $ 5 $ is prime it has a unique inverse for each number modulo $ 5 $ that is for each number $ n (\bmod 5) $ there exists a unique number $ n^{ 1}(\bmod 5) $ such that $ n\cdot n^{ 1}\equiv1(\bmod 5) $

 Now notice that we can approximate $ \sqrt{3} $ by taking its infinite continued fraction and stopping it after a finite number of iterations We have the first couple of approximations as 
 
 \[ 1 \] 
 \[ 1+\frac{1}{1}=2 \] 
 \[ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{5}{3} \] 
 \[ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{1}}}=\frac{7}{4} \] 
 \[ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2}}}}=\frac{19}{11} \] 
 \[ 1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{1}}}}}=\boxed{\frac{26}{15}} \] 
 
 and we can stop here because any more iterations and the denominator would be greater than $ 15 $ 
 
 alternate route Another way problems like these can be done is using Newton's Method $ \sqrt{3} $ is a root of the equation $ x^2 3=0 $ Since $ \sqrt{3}\approx2 $ we begin by finding the tangent line approximation at the point $ (2 1) $ 
 
 The slope of the tangent line at that point is $ 2(2)=4 $ and so the equation of the tangent line is $ y 1=4(x 2) $ or $ y=4x 7 $ This has an x intercept at $ x=\frac{7}{4} $ which is our first approximation Now we find the tangent line approximation at $ \left(\frac{7}{4} \frac{1}{16}\right) $ This slope would be $ 2\left(\frac{7}{4}\right)=\frac{7}{2} $ The equation of this tangent line is $ y \frac{1}{16}=\frac{7}{2}\left(x \frac{7}{4}\right) $ or $ y=\frac{7}{2}x \frac{97}{16} $ which has an x intercept at $ x=\frac{97}{56} $ This is our second approximation However we've clearly skipped the desired approximation and so this method won't work for this specific problem although it would probably work for similar ones",true,true,1,Find the best approximation of $\sqrt{3}$ by a rational number with denominator less than or equal to $15$,false

 Let the center of the circle be $O$ and let $P$ be any point on circle $O$ subtending arc $BC$ Then \[\angle BOC = 2 \angle BPC = 2 \cdot (180 \angle BXC) = 180 \angle BAC\] So quadrilateral $ABOC$ is cyclic The point $X$ that we want is the intersection of $AO$ and the circle If $ABOC$ is cyclic then because $\angle BAO$ and $\angle CAO$ face the same chord length ( $OB$ ) they equal So $X$ is the inradius Let $r$ be the radius of circle $O$ then by Ptolemy $28r = 14(r + AX)$ so $r = AX$ We now apply Stewart's Theorem to $\triangle ABO$ $r^2 \cdot r + 169r = BX^2 \cdot 2r + r \cdot r \cdot 2r$ (*) So we just need to find $BX$ 
 
 Dropping the altitude from $X$ to $BC$ $AC$ and $AB$ and calling the resulting points $H_1$ $H_2$ and $H_3$ respectively we can write a system of equations with $BH_1 = BH_3 = a$ $CH_1 = CH_2 = b$ and $AH_3 = AH_2 = c$ We have $a + b = 14$ $b + c = 15$ and $a + c = 13$ so $a = BH_1 = 6$ To compute $BX$ we just find $\cos{(\angle RBX)}$ Since $\cos{(2 \angle RBX)} = \tfrac{5}{13}$ (this can be seen by dropping the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ ) by Half Angle Formulas $\cos{(\angle RBX)} = \sqrt{\tfrac{1 + (5/13)}{2}}$ or $\tfrac{3}{\sqrt{13}}$ Hence $BX = 2\sqrt{13}$

 Label $ \theta $ as in the diagram above so that the height of the trapezoid is $ \cos(\theta) $ The area of the trapezoid can then be expressed as the sum of the areas of the middle rectangle and twice the area of one of the right triangles on the side Using $ \frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C) $ to find the area of the right triangle we find that the area of the trapezoid is $ \cos(\theta)+2(\frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta))=\cos(\theta)+\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) $ 
 
 To find the maximum of that value we find when the derivative is equal to $ 0 $ The derivative of $ \cos(\theta) $ is just $ \sin(\theta) $ and we can use the product rule on $ \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) $ to find that the derivative of that product is $ \sin^2(\theta)+\cos^2(\theta) $ and so the derivative of the entire function is $ \cos^2(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) \sin(\theta) $ 
 
 We can replace $ \cos^2(\theta) $ with $ 1 \sin^2(\theta) $ to get a quadratic in terms of $ \sin(\theta) $ We have $ 2\sin^2(\theta)+\sin(\theta) 1=0 $ and so $ \sin(\theta)=\frac{1}{2} $ or $ 1 $ We can immediately discard $ 1 $ and so $ \sin(\theta)=\frac{1}{2} $ Since $ \theta $ is clearly less than $ \frac{\pi}{2} $ we see that $ \cos(\theta)=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} $ Thus the area of the trapezoid is $ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)=\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{4}} $",true,true,1,An isosceles trapezoid has legs and shorter base of length $1$.

 So either we have an integer $x$ such that $1 \le x \le 400$ and $x = p_1^{14}$ where $p_1$ is prime or $x = p_1^{2} \times p_2^{4}$ where $p_1$ and $p_2$ are prime and $p_1 \ne p_2$ 
 
 The smallest positive prime is $2$ and since $2^{14} > 2^{9} > 400$ we have that $x$ can't be in the form $p_1^{14}$ 
 
 Now we look for all integers between 1 and 400 for the second case where $x = p_1^2 \times p_2^4$ 
 
 First assume $p_2 = 2$ 
 
 Then we have that $p_1^2 \times 16 \le 400 \rightarrow p_1^2 \le \frac{400}{16} \rightarrow p_1 \le \frac{20}{4} = 5$ (note that $p_1$ must be positive) 
 
 The primes under $\le 5 \ne 2$ are $3 5$ So there are $2$ choices when $p_2 = 2$ 
 
 Now assume $p_2 = 3$ 
 
 Then $p_1^2 \times 81 \le 400 \rightarrow p_1^2 \le \frac{400}{81} \rightarrow p_1 \le \frac{20}{9} = 2\frac{2}{9}$ 
 
 The primes $\le 2\frac{2}{9}$ is only $2$ so there is $1$ choice in this case We have that $5^4 = 625 > 400$ so $p_2 < 5$ 
 
 Therefore we have checked all the cases with the total being $2+1 = \boxed{3}$

 Likewise if $a+b$ is even then $a b$ is even If $a$ is even in this case then $b$ must be even and if $a$ is odd in this case then $b$ must be odd and we have that numbers of the same parity when added or subtracted to each other So that means if $a^2 b^2$ is even it must be a multiple of $4$ 
 
 It's easy to prove that all odd numbers can be represented Call the odd number you want represented as the difference of $2$ squares $2x 1$ where $x$ is an integer If $a b=1$ and $a+b = 2x 1$ then we have that $2a = 2x a=x b=x 1$ so both are integers and can express any odd number $2x 1$ as all odd numbers can be expressed as $2x 1$ 
 
 In the same fashion we can prove that all multiples of $4$ can be obtained Call a multiple of $4 4x$ where x is an integer Then we have that $a+b = 2x a b = 2 \rightarrow 2a = 2x + 2 \rightarrow a = x+1 \rightarrow b = x 1$ Since $4x$ represents all multiples of $4$ we have now shown that each multiple of $4$ can be represented as $(a+b)(a b) = a^2 b^2$ 
 
 (wait was what I just did really necessary?)

 Anyways this is how I did that problem First off if there are All $1s$ then there can be no consecutive $0s$ That's $1$ way If there's $1$ $0$ then there are still no ways for there to be consecutive $0s$ That's $\dbinom{10}{1} = 10$ ways If there are $2$ $0s$ then there are $\dbinom{10}{2}$ ways to arrange all then numbers (choose $2$ spots to where you can place the $0s$ ) and then $9$ ways such that the $0$ s are next to each other (from $0$ $1s$ in front of them to $8$ $1s$ in front of them) $45 9 = 36$ ways in this case With $3$ $0s$ this problem gets way uglier We can't do what we did before that would take way too much time to count Instead we know that the $0s$ must be separated like so $01010$ 
 
 There are now $5$ $1s$ left In this case we can use balls and urns We know that the number of $1s$ before the first $0$ added to the number of $1s$ in between the first $2$ $0s$ plus the number of $1s$ between the last $2$ $0s$ plus the number of ones after the last $0$ has to add up to $5$ (not counting the $1s$ already put in place ) 
 
 So there are $5$ ""balls"" and $4$ ""urns"" Since some of these ""urns"" may contain $0$ $1s$ we have that the number of ways to have no consecutive $0s$ is $\dbinom{8}{3} = 56$ 
 
 Now we do the same for $4$ $0s \rightarrow 0101010$ Now there are 3 $1s$ or ""balls"" left and $5$ ""urns"" (before the first $0$ in between $0s$ then after the last $0$ ) We obtain the binomial $\dbinom{7}{4} = 35$ 
 
 Finally we have the case where there are $5$ $0s$ Using the same technique (although not necessary) We have the sequence $010101010$ Now we have $6$ total places to place the final $1$ (again before the first $0$ in between 2 consecutive $0$ s and after the last $0$ ) 
 
 So the total is $1+10+36+56+35+6 = 144$ ways to not have consecutive $0s$ (note that if there are more than $5 0s$ there must be at least one pair of consecutive $0s$ ) 
 
 So the total probability is $\frac{1024 144}{1024} = 1 \frac{9}{64} = \boxed{\frac{55}{64}}$

 S4 Old concern about P4 I am not sure how this is possible I have this much Suppose $n$ has more than $1$ prime factor Let its smallest prime factors then be $a$ and $b$ with $a<b$ It must be the case that $a_2=a$ and $a_3=b$ Then $ a^3\equiv b^3 a^3\equiv a_3^3 a_2^3\equiv n\equiv 0\pmod{b}\implies a\equiv 0\pmod{b}$ which contradicts $a$ being prime and distinct from $b$ Thus $n$ has only $1$ prime factor Let $p$ be this prime factor and let $e$ be such that $p^e=n$ We have $p^3(p^3 1)=(p^2)^3 p^3=a_3^3 a_2^3=n=p^e$ 
 This means that $p^3 1$ is a power of $p$ which is impossible Solution $a_2$ must be the smallest prime factor of $n$ Suppose $a_3$ is a prime number Then $ a_2^3\equiv {a_3}^3 {a_2}^3\equiv n\equiv 0\pmod{a_3}\implies a_2\equiv 0\pmod{a_3}$ which contradicts $a_2$ being prime and distinct from $a_3$ Then it must be the case that $a_3=a_2^2$ We have $n=a_3^3 a_2^3=(a_2^2)^3 a_2^3=a_2^3(a_2^3 1)=a_2^3(a_2 1)(a_2^2+a_2+1)$ If $a_2>2$ then $a_2 1>1$ and has a prime factor This prime factor must be less than $a_2$ But it is also a factor of $n$ which contradicts $a_2$ being the smallest prime factor of $n$ Thus $a_2 1=1\implies a_2=2$ and $n=a_3^3 a_2^3=(2^2)^3 2^3=64 8=56$

For example, the compositions of $3$ are $3$, $1+2$, $2+1$, and $1+1+1$; the first has one term, the second and third have two each, and the last has $3$ terms, so $P(3) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 8$. Compute $P(9)$. p7. Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 7$, $AC = 8$, and $BC = 9$. Let the angle bisector of $ A$ intersect $BC$ at $D$. Let $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to line $AD$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Find $ME$. p8. Call a function $g$ lower-approximating for $f$ on the interval $[a, b]$ if for all $x \in [a, b]$, $f(x) \ge g(x)$. Find the maximum possible value of $\int_1^2 g(x)dx$ where $g(x)$ is a linear lower-approximating function for $f(x) = x^x$ on $[1, 2]$. p9.

 Bogus Clearly $q=q'^2$ for $q'\in\mathbb{Q}$ then $x_0$ satisfies $(x p q')^3=r$ The only restriction is $ (p+q')^3 r=\tfrac{1}{8}$ which is irrelevant to minimizing $S=a+b= 3(p+q')+3(p+q')^2$ i e we can have $p+q'$ to be whatever we want and $r$ is accordingly determined It remains to minimize $S$ given that $p+q'\in\mathbb{Z}$ which is pretty obviously $\boxed{0}$ 
 
 Actual The error with the above solution is that it neglects the leading coefficient $8$ which although irrelevant in equations themselves subtly affects the $a b\in\mathbb{Z}$ condition Particularly consider $S$ above which is minimized at $p+q'=\tfrac{1}{2}$ Though in that case $ 3(p+q') 3(p+q')^2\not\in\mathbb{Z}$ indeed holds these aren't actually the coefficients $a$ and $b$ instead $a= 24(p+q')$ and $b=24(p+q')^2$ implying that $p+q'=\tfrac{1}{2}$ is in fact possible Accordingly the answer is $\boxed{ 6}$",true,false,0,"Let $P(x)=8x^3+ax+b+1$ for $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$.

 \[\sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}(P)}\frac{1}{r^2}=\left(\frac{a_1}{a_0}\right)^2 2\cdot\frac{a_2}{a_0} \] derivable by computing $\sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}(Q)}r^2$ for $Q(x) =P(\tfrac{1}{x})$ (which has the ""reverse coefficients"" of $P$ ) 
 
 Now because the $f^n(x)$ are odd and so $\tfrac{f^n(x)}{x}$ are even so that $a_1=0$ in the paradigm above it suffices to keep track of the cubic $a_3(n)$ and linear $a_1(n)$ coefficients in the $f^n(x)$ which are the quadratic $a_2'(n)$ and constant $a_0'(n)$ coefficients in the $\tfrac{f^n(x)}{x}$ as needed Claim $a_3(n)=( 3)^{n 1}\cdot\tfrac{9^n 1}{8}$ and $a_1(n)=( 3)^n$ 
 Proof The base case clearly holds assume the assertion holds for some $n=k$ Consider 
 \begin{align*}
f^{k+1}(x)&=f(f^k(x))\\
&=f^k(x)^3 3f^k(x)\\
&=(\dots+a_3(k)x^3+a_1(k)x)^3 3(\dots+a_3(k)x^3+a_1(k)x)\\
&=(\dots+( 3)^{k 1}\cdot\tfrac{9^k 1}{8}\cdot x^3+( 3)^k\cdot x)^3 3(\dots+( 3)^{k 1}\cdot\tfrac{9^k 1}{8}\cdot x^3+( 3)^k\cdot x) \end{align*} Above the first term contains terms all of degree $>3$ except for the last $( 3)^{3k}\cdot x^3$ Likewise the second term contains terms of degree $x>3$ except for the last two $( 3)^k\cdot\tfrac{9^k 1}{8}\cdot x^3$ and $( 3)^{k+1}\cdot x$ Accordingly \begin{align*}
a_3(k+1)&=( 3)^{3k}+( 3)^k\cdot\tfrac{9^k 1}{8}=( 3)^k\cdot\tfrac{9^{k+1} 1}{8}\\
a_1(k+1)&=( 3)^{k+1} \end{align*} which is the assertion for $n=k+1$ $\Box$ 
 
 So $a_2'(2022)=( 3)^{2021}\cdot\tfrac{9^{2022} 1}{8}$ and $a_0'(2022)=( 3)^{2022}$ are the quadratic and constant coefficients of $\tfrac{f^{2022}(x)}{x}$ which implies that (since $a_2(n)=a_1'(n)=0$ for all $n$ as previously noted) 
 \begin{align*}
\sum_{r\in\mathcal{R}}\frac{1}{r^2}&= 2\cdot\frac{a_2'(2022)}{a_0'(2022)}\\
&= 2\cdot\frac{( 3)^{2021}\cdot\tfrac{9^{2022} 1}{8}}{( 3)^{2022}}\\
&=\frac{3^{4044} 1}{12} \\
\end{align*} Ergo $3+4044+1+12=4060$ which contradicts the official answer of $\boxed{4072}$ 
 
 Motivation Of course $\tfrac{9^n 1}{8}=9^{n 1}+9^{n 2}+\dots+1$ was the actual form initially discovered after staring at the smaller cases I tried considering $b(n)=\tfrac{a_3(n)=a_2'(n)}{3^{n 1}}$ and following an embarrassingly long time finally noted that $\Delta b(n)=9^n$",true,false,0,"Let $f^1(x)=x^3-3x$.

 We ""wrap out"" the perimeter of $\triangle ACL$ as described above define $B'\in\overline{BC}$ such that $LA=LA'$ and $K'\in\overrightarrow{AC}$ such that $AK=AK'$ Then the perimeter condition implies that $CA'=CK$ and because $\angle A'CK=\angle K'CK=90+\tfrac{\gamma}{2}$ we have that $\triangle A'CK\cong\triangle K'CK$ Hence $\angle CA'K=\angle CK'K=\tfrac{\alpha}{2}$

Then $A$ waits for a while. If $B$ is not eaten by a tiger, then $A$ moves to that point as well.

(4 digits) Define the following: $\bullet$ $A = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n^6}$ $\bullet$ $B = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{n^6+1}$ $\bullet$ $C = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{(n+1)^6}$ $\bullet$ $D = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{(2n-1)^6}$ $\bullet$ $E = \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^6}$ Consider the ratios $\frac{B}{A}, \frac{C}{A}, \frac{D}{A}, \frac{E}{A}$. Exactly one of the four is a rational number. Let that number be $r/s$, where $r$ and $s$ are nonnegative integers and $gcd \,(r, s) = 1$. Concatenate $r, s$. (It might be helpful to know that $A = \frac{\pi^6}{945}$.) DL 10. (3 digits) You have a sheet of paper, which you lay on the xy plane so that its vertices are at $(-1, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 100)$, $(-1, 100)$. You remove a section of the bottom of the paper by cutting along the function $y = f(x)$, where $f$ satisfies $f(1) = f(-1) = 0$. (In other words, you keep the bottom two vertices.) You do this again with another sheet of paper. Then you roll both of them into identical cylinders, and you realize that you can attach them to form an $L$-shaped elbow tube. We can write $f\left( \frac13 \right)+f\left( \frac16 \right) = \frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{\pi c}$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free. $Find a+b+c$. DL 11.

(3 digits) Three cones have bases on the same plane, externally tangent to each other. The cones all face the same direction. Two of the cones have radii of $2$, and the other cone has a radius of $3$. The two cones with radii $2$ have height $4$, and the other cone has height $6$. Let $V$ be the volume of the tetrahedron with three of its vertices as the three vertices of the cones and the fourth vertex as the center of the base of the cone with height $6$. Find $V^2$. Down and to the right $e^{5\pi i/3}$ DR 1. (2 digits) For some reason, people in math problems like to paint houses. Alice can paint a house in one hour. Bob can paint a house in six hours. If they work together, it takes them seven hours to paint a house. You might be thinking ""What? That's not right!"" but I did not make a mistake. When Alice and Bob work together, they get distracted very easily and simultaneously send text messages to each other. When they are texting, they are not getting any work done. When they are not texting, they are painting at their normal speeds (as if they were working alone). Carl, the owner of the house decides to check up on their work. He randomly picks a time during the seven hours. The probability that they are texting during that time can be written as $r/s$, where r and s are integers and $gcd \,(r, s) = 1$. What is $r + s$? DR 4. (3 digits) Let $a_1 = 2 +\sqrt2$ and $b_1 =\sqrt2$, and for $n \ge 1$, $a_{n+1} = |a_n - b_n|$ and $b_{n+1} = a_n + b_n$. The minimum value of $\frac{a^2_n+a_nb_n-6b^2_n}{6b^2_n-a^2_n}$ can be written in the form $a\sqrt{b} - c$, where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free.

Fill in the crossword above with answers to the problems below. Notice that there are three directions instead of two. You are probably used to ""down"" and ""across,"" but this crossword has ""1,"" $e^{4\pi i/3}$, and $e^{5\pi i/3}$. You can think of these labels as complex numbers pointing in the direction to fill in the spaces. In other words ""1"" means ""across"", $e^{4\pi i/3}$ means ""down and to the left,"" and $e^{5\pi i/3}$ means ""down and to the right."" To fill in the answer to, for example, $12$ across, start at the hexagon labeled $12$, and write the digits, proceeding to the right along the gray line. (Note: $12$ across has space for exactly $5$ digits.) Each hexagon is worth one point, and must be filled by something from the set $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$. Note that $\pi$ is not in the set, and neither is $i$, nor $\sqrt2$, nor $\heartsuit$,etc. None of the answers will begin with a $0$. ""Concatenate $a$ and $b$"" means to write the digits of $a$, followed by the digits of $b$. For example, concatenating $10$ and $3$ gives $103$. (It's not the same as concatenating $3$ and $10$.)

(3 digits) Suppose you draw $5$ vertices of a convex pentagon (but not the sides!). Let $N$ be the number of ways you can draw at least $0$ straight line segments between the vertices so that no two line segments intersect in the interior of the pentagon. What is $N - 64$? (Note what the question is asking for! You have been warned!) A 5. (3 digits) Among integers $\{1, 2,..., 10^{2012}\}$, let $n$ be the number of numbers for which the sum of the digits is divisible by $5$. What are the first three digits (from the left) of $n$? A 6. (3 digits) Bob is punished by his math teacher and has to write all perfect squares, one after another. His teacher's blackboard has space for exactly $2012$ digits. He can stop when he cannot fit the next perfect square on the board. (At the end, there might be some space left on the board - he does not write only part of the next perfect square.) If $n^2$ is the largest perfect square he writes, what is $n$? A 8. (3 digits) How many positive integers $n$ are there such that $n \le 2012$, and the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $2012$ is a prime number? A 9. (4 digits) I have a random number machine generator that is very good at generating integers between $1$ and $256$, inclusive, with equal probability. However, right now, I want to produce a random number between $1$ and $n$, inclusive, so I do the following: $\bullet$ I use my machine to generate a number between $1$ and $256$. Call this $a$. $\bullet$ I take a and divide it by $n$ to get remainder $r$. If $r \ne 0$, then I record $r$ as the randomly generated number. If $r = 0$, then I record $n$ instead. Note that this process does not necessarily produce all numbers with equal probability, but that is okay. I apply this process twice to generate two numbers randomly between $1$ and $10$. Let $p$ be the probability that the two numbers are equal. What is $p \cdot 2^{16}$? A 12. (5 digits) You and your friend play the following dangerous game. You two start off at some point $(x, y)$ on the plane, where $x$ and $y$ are nonnegative integers. When it is player $A$'s turn, A tells his opponent $B$ to move to another point on the plane. Then $A$ waits for a while. If $B$ is not eaten by a tiger, then $A$ moves to that point as well. From a point $(x, y)$ there are three places $A$ can tell $B$ to walk to: leftwards to $(x - 1, y)$, downwards to $(x, y-1)$, and simultaneously downwards and leftwards to $(x-1, y-1)$. However, you cannot move to a point with a negative coordinate. Now, what was this about being eaten by a tiger? There is a tiger at the origin, which will eat the first person that goes there! Needless to say, you lose if you are eaten. Consider all possible starting points $(x, y)$ with $0 \le x \le 346$ and $0 \le y \le 346$, and $x$ and $y$ are not both zero. Also suppose that you two play strategically, and you go first (i.e., by telling your friend where to go). For how many of the starting points do you win? Down and to the left $e^{4\pi i/3}$ DL 2.

Your answer in its simplest form can be written as $\frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where where $a, b, c$ are integers and $b$ is square-free. Find $abc$. DL 3.

8190,"RulesTime Limit: 25 minutes Maximum Possible Score: 81 The following is a mathematical Sudoku puzzle which is also a crossword. Your job is to fill in as many blanks as you possibly can, including all shaded squares. You do not earn extra points for showing your work; the only points you get are for correctly filled-in squares. You get one point for each correctly filled-in square. You should read through the following rules carefully before starting. $\bullet$ Your time limit for this round is $25$ minutes, in addition to the five minutes you get for reading the rules. So make use of your time wisely. The round is based more on speed than on perfect reasoning, so use your intuition well, and be fast. $\bullet$ This is a Sudoku puzzle; all the squares should be filled in with the digits $1$ through $9$ so that every row and column contains each digit exactly once. In addition, each of the nine $3\times 3$ boxes that compose the grid also contains each digit exactly once. Furthermore, this is a super-Sudoku puzzle; in addition to satisfying all these conditions, the four $3\times 3$ boxes with red outlines also contain each of $1,..., 9$ exactly once. This last property is important to keep in mind – it may help you solve the puzzle faster. $\bullet$ Just to restate the idea, you can use the digits $1$ through $9$, but not $0$. You may not use any other symbol, such as $\pi$ or $e$ or $\epsilon$. Each square gets exactly one digit. $\bullet$ The grid is also a crossword puzzle; the usual rules apply. The shaded grey squares are the “black” squares of an ordinary crossword puzzle. The white squares as well as the shaded yellow ones count as the “white” crossword squares. All squares, white or shaded, count as ordinary Sudoku squares. $\bullet$ If you obtain the unique solution to the crossword puzzle, then this solution extends to a unique solution to the Sudoku puzzle. $\bullet$ You may use a graphing calculator to help you solve the clues. The following hints and tips may prove useful while solving the puzzle. $\bullet$ Use the super-Sudoku structure described in the first rule; use all the symmetries you have. Remember that we are not looking for proofs or methods, only for correctly filled-in squares. $\bullet$ If you find yourself stuck on a specific clue, it is nothing to worry about. You can obtain the solution to that clue later on by solving other clues and figuring out certain digits of your desired solution. Just move on to the rest of the puzzle. $\bullet$ As you progress through the puzzle, keep filling in all squares you have found on your solution sheet, including the shaded ones. Remember that for scoring, the shaded grey squares count the same as the white ones. Good luck! Across 1 Across.

Your job is to fill in as many blanks as you possibly can, including all shaded squares. You do not earn extra points for showing your work; the only points you get are for correctly filled-in squares. You get one point for each correctly filled-in square. You should read through the following rules carefully before starting. $\bullet$ Your time limit for this round is $25$ minutes, in addition to the five minutes you get for reading the rules. So make use of your time wisely. The round is based more on speed than on perfect reasoning, so use your intuition well, and be fast. $\bullet$ This is a Sudoku puzzle; all the squares should be filled in with the digits $1$ through $9$ so that every row and column contains each digit exactly once. In addition, each of the nine $3\times 3$ boxes that compose the grid also contains each digit exactly once. Furthermore, this is a super-Sudoku puzzle; in addition to satisfying all these conditions, the four $3\times 3$ boxes with red outlines also contain each of $1,..., 9$ exactly once. This last property is important to keep in mind – it may help you solve the puzzle faster. $\bullet$ Just to restate the idea, you can use the digits $1$ through $9$, but not $0$. You may not use any other symbol, such as $\pi$ or $e$ or $\epsilon$. Each square gets exactly one digit. $\bullet$ The grid is also a crossword puzzle; the usual rules apply. The shaded grey squares are the “black” squares of an ordinary crossword puzzle. The white squares as well as the shaded yellow ones count as the “white” crossword squares. All squares, white or shaded, count as ordinary Sudoku squares. $\bullet$ If you obtain the unique solution to the crossword puzzle, then this solution extends to a unique solution to the Sudoku puzzle. $\bullet$ You may use a graphing calculator to help you solve the clues. The following hints and tips may prove useful while solving the puzzle. $\bullet$ Use the super-Sudoku structure described in the first rule; use all the symmetries you have. Remember that we are not looking for proofs or methods, only for correctly filled-in squares. $\bullet$ If you find yourself stuck on a specific clue, it is nothing to worry about. You can obtain the solution to that clue later on by solving other clues and figuring out certain digits of your desired solution. Just move on to the rest of the puzzle. $\bullet$ As you progress through the puzzle, keep filling in all squares you have found on your solution sheet, including the shaded ones. Remember that for scoring, the shaded grey squares count the same as the white ones. Good luck! Across 1 Across. The following is a normal addition where each letter represents a (distinct) digit: $$GOT + TO + GO + TO = TOP$$This certainly does not have a unique solution. However, you discover suddenly that $G = 2$ and $P \notin \{4, 7\}$. Then what is the numeric value of the expression $GOT \times TO$? 3 Across. A strobogrammatic number which reads the same upside down, e.g. $619$. On the other hand, a triangular number is a number of the form $n(n + 1)/2$ for some $n \in N$, e.g. $15$ (therefore, the $i^{th}$ triangular number $T_i$ is the sum of $1$ through $i$). Let $a$ be the third strobogrammatic prime number. Let $b$ be the smaller number of the smallest pair of triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers. What is the value of $ab$? 6 Across. A positive integer $m$ is said to be palindromic in base $\ell$ if, when written in base $\ell$, its digits are the same front-to-back and back-to-front. For $j, k \in N$, let $\mu (j, k)$ be the smallest base-$10$ integer that is palindromic in base $j$ as well as in base$ k$, and let $\nu (j, k):= (j + k) \cdot \mu (j, k)$. Find the value of $\nu (5, 9)$. 7 Across. Suppose you have the unique solution to this Sudoku puzzle. In that solution, let $X$ denote the sum of all digits in the shaded grey squares. Similarly, let $Y$ denote the sum of all numbers in the shaded yellow squares on the upper left block (i.e. the $3 \times 3$ box outlined red towards the top left). Concatenate $X$ with $Y$ in that order, and write that down. 8 Across. For any $n \in N$ such that $1 < n < 10$, define the sequence $X_{n,1}$,$X_{n,2}$,$...$ by $X_{n,1} = n$, and for $r \ge 2$, X_{n,r} is smallest number $k \in N$ larger than X_{n,r-1} such that $k$ and the sum of digits of $k$ are both powers of $n$. For instance, $X_{3,1 = 3}$, $X_{3,2} = 9$, $X_{3,3} = 27$, and so on. Concatenate $X_{2,2}$ with $X_{2,4}$, and write down the answer. 9 Across. Find positive integers $x, y,z$ satisfying the following properties: $y$ is obtained by subtracting $93$ from $x$, and $z$ is obtained by subtracting $183$ from $y$, furthermore, $x, y$ and $z$ in their base-$10$ representations contain precisely all the digits from $1$ through $9$ once (i.e. concatenating $x, y$ and $z$ yields a valid $9$-digit Sudoku answer). Obviously, write down the concatenation of $x, y$ and $z$ in that order. 11 Across. Find the largest pair of two-digit consecutive prime numbers $a$ and $b$ (with $a < b$) such that the sum of the digits of a plus the sum of the digits of b is also a prime number. Write the concatenation of $a$ and $b$. 12 Across. Suppose you have a strip of $2n + 1$ squares, with n frogs on the $n$ squares on the left, and $n$ toads on the $n$ squares on the right. A move consists either of a toad or a frog sliding to an adjacent square if it is vacant, or of a toad or a frog jumping one square over another one and landing on the next square if it is vacant. For instance, the starting position has the position or the position as results of valid first moves. What is the minimum number of moves needed to swap the toads with the frogs if $n = 5$? How about $n = 6$? Concatenate your answers. 15 Across. Let $w$ be the largest number such that $w$, $2w$ and $3w$ together contain every digit from $1$ through $9$ exactly once. Let $x$ be the smallest integer with the property that its first $5$ multiples contain the digit $9$. A Leyland number is an integer of the form $m^n + n^m$ for integers $m, n > 1$. Let $y$ be the fourth Leyland number. A Pillai prime is a prime number $p$ for which there is an integer $n > 0$ such that $n! \equiv - 1 (mod \,\, p)$, but $p \not\equiv 1 (mod \,\, n)$. Let $z$ be the fourth Pillai prime. Concatenate $w$, $x, y$ and $z$ in that order to obtain a permutation of $1,..., 9$. Write down this permutation. 19 Across. A hoax number $k \in N$ is one for which the sum of its digits (in base $10$) equals the sum of the digits of its distinct prime factors (in base $10$). For instance, the distinct prime factors of $22$ are $2$ and $11$, and we have $2+2 = 2+(1+1)$. In fact, $22$ is the first hoax number. What is the second? 20 Across. Let $a, b$ and $c$ be distinct $2$-digit numbers satisfying the following properties: – $a$ is the largest integer expressible as $a = x^y = y^x$, for distinct integers $x$ and $y$. – $b$ is the smallest integer which has three partitions into three parts, which all give the same product (which turns out to be $1200$) when multiplied. – $c$ is the largest number that is the sum of the digits of its cube. Concatenate $a, b$ and $c$, and write down the resulting 6-digit prime number. 21 Across. Suppose $N = \underline{a}\, \underline{b} \, \underline{c} \, \underline{d}$ is a $4$-digit number with digits $a, b, c$ and $d$, such that $N = a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d^7$. Find $N$. 22 Across.

For some $a, b, c \in N$, let the polynomial $$p(x) = x^5 - 252x^4 + ax^3 - bx^2 + cx - 62604360$$have five distinct roots that are positive integers. Four of these are 2-digit numbers, while the last one is single-digit. Concatenate all five roots in decreasing order, and write down the result. 2 Down. Gene, Ashwath and Cosmin together have $2511$ math books. Gene now buys as many math books as he already has, and Cosmin sells off half his math books. This leaves them with $2919$ books in total. After this, Ashwath suddenly sells off all his books to buy a private jet, leaving Gene and Cosmin with a total of $2184$ books. How many books did Gene, Ashwath and Cosmin have to begin with? Concatenate the three answers (in the order Gene, Ashwath, Cosmin) and write down the result. 3 Down. A regular octahedron is a convex polyhedron composed of eight congruent faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle; four of them meet at each vertex. For instance, the following diagram depicts a regular octahedron: Let $T$ be a regular octahedron of edge length $28$. What is the total surface area of $T$, rounded to the nearest integer? 4 Down. Evaluate the value of the expression $$\sum^{T_{25}}_{k=T_{24}+1}k, $$where $T_i$ denotes the $i^{th}$ triangular number (the sum of the integers from $1$ through $i$). 5 Down. Suppose $r$ and $s$ are consecutive multiples of$ 9$ satisfying the following properties: – $r$ is the smallest positive integer that can be written as the sum of $3$ positive squares in $3$ different ways. – $s$ is the smallest $2$-digit number that is a Woodall number as well as a base-$10$ Harshad number. A Woodall number is any number of the form $n \cdot 2^n - 1$ for some $n \in N$. A base-$10$ Harshad number is divisible by the sum of its digits in base $10$. Concatenate $r$ and $s$ and write down the result. 10 Down. For any $k \in N$, let $\phi_p(k)$ denote the sum of the distinct prime factors of $k$. Suppose $N$ is the largest integer less than $50000$ satisfying $\phi_p(N) =\phi_p(N + 1)$, where the common value turns out to be a meager $55$. What is$ N$? 13 Down. The $n^{th}$ $s$-gonal number $P(s, n)$ is defined as $$P(s, n) = (s - 3)T_{n-1} + T_n$$where $T_i$ is the $i^{th}$ triangular number (recall that the $i^{th}$ triangular number is the sum of the numbers $1$ through $i$). Find the least $N$ such that $N$ is both a $34$-gonal number, and a $163$-gonal number. 14 Down. A biprime is a positive integer that is the product of precisely two (not necessarily distinct) primes. A cluster of biprimes is an ordered triple $(m,m + 1,m + 2)$ of consecutive integers that are biprimes. There are precisely three clusters of biprimes below 100. Denote these by, say, $$\{(p, p + 1, p + 2), (q, q + 1,q + 2), (r, r + 1, r + 2)\}$$and add the condition that $p + 2 < q < r - 2$ to fix the three clusters. Interestingly, $p + 1$ and $q$ are both multiples of $17$. Concatenate $q$ with $p + 1$ in that order, and write down the result. 16 Down. Find the least positive integer $m$ (written in base $10$ as $m = \underline{a} \, \underline{b} \, \underline{c} $, with digits $a, b,c$), such that $m = (b + c)^a$. 17 Down.

 Moreover if $h(x) = \tfrac{1}{x} + 1$ then $f(h(x)) = h(r(x))$ and $g(h(x)) = h(s(x))$ Since $2 = h(1)$ this means that $h^{ 1}(x)$ is the limit of 
 \[r^1(s(1)) r^1(s(r^2(s(1)))) r^1(s(r^2(s(r^3(s(1)))))) \dots \] Now observe that

 Lemma $b_n > n $ 
 
 Proof Assume for the sake of contradiction that $b_n\leq n $ Then there exists $m=b_n $ so consider the two digit number $N=\overline{1(m 1)}_{b_n} $ Clearly this is a contradiction since $m\nmid b_n + m 1 $ Hence $b_n > n $ $\blacksquare$ 
 
 Claim $b_n = 1 + \text{lcm}(1 2 \dots n) $ 
 
 Proof Consider $N=\overline{1(m 1)}_{b_n} $ which exists for all $2\leq m\leq n$ from our lemma Then 
 $$b_n+m 1\equiv b_n 1\equiv0\pmod m $$ Thus taking CRT over all $2\leq m\leq n$ 
 $$b_n\equiv 1\pmod {\text{lcm}(1 2 \dots n)} $$ Hence the smallest value for $b_n$ is $b_n = 1 + \text{lcm}(1 2 \dots n) $ as desired $\blacksquare$

 Solution So note that $73|f(k)$ iff 73 divides the sum of the elements of $\mathbb{F}_{73}$ with order $\frac{72}{\gcd(k 72)}$ This is because when you raise primitive to the $k$ t h power the set of outputs is the set of elements with order $\frac{72}{\gcd(k 72)}$ and the outputs evenly space themselves Furthermore there are $\varphi(d)$ numbers $k$ so that $g^k$ has order $d$ The sum of the numbers with order $d$ is the same as the sum of the $d$ th primitive roots of unity so it is $\mu(d)$ 
 
 So we want to sum $\varphi(d)$ over all divisors of $d$ with $\mu(d)=0$ since otherwise it is 1 or 1 which is not divisible by 73 This is all divisors of 72 except the squarefree ones which are 1 2 3 6 Thus there are $72 \varphi(1) \varphi(2) \varphi(3) \varphi(6)=66$ numbers Except the question asks for k<2015 so we have to do $66\cdot\frac{2016}{72} 1=1847$ since 2016 doesn't work but 2015 works So this was a cool problem except bill decided to make it k<2015 so </3",true,false,0,"Given a positive integer $k$, let $f(k)$ be the sum of the $k$-th powers of the primitive roots of $73$.

 So to evaluate $f(17) \pmod{25} $ we first need to find $17^{{17}^{17}} \pmod{20} $ 
 
 And to compute $17^{{17}^{17}} \pmod{20} $ we first need to compute $17^{17} \pmod {8} $ 
 
 $\implies 17^{17} \equiv 1^{17} \equiv 1 \pmod {8}$ 
 
 So $f(17) \equiv 17^{17} \equiv 2 \pmod{25} $ 
 
 Thus $\boxed{f(17) \equiv 77 \pmod{100}}$ 
 
 Now $f(18) \equiv 0 \pmod{4} $ 
 
 To evaluate $f(18) \pmod{25} $ we first need to compute $18^{{18}^{18}} \pmod{20} $ 
 
 $18^{{18}^{18}} \equiv 0 \pmod{4}$ and $18^{{18}^{18}} \equiv 1\pmod{5} $ 
 
 $\implies 18^{{18}^{18}} \equiv 16 \pmod{20}$ 
 
 $\implies f(18) \equiv 18^{16} \equiv 1\pmod{25}$ 
 
 $\boxed{f(18) \equiv 76 \pmod{100}}$ 
 
 Now $f(19) \equiv 3\pmod{4}$ and $f(19) \equiv 19^{ 1} \equiv 4\pmod{25} $ 
 
 $\boxed{f(19) \equiv 79\pmod{100}}$ 
 
 And $\boxed{f(20) \equiv 0\pmod{100}}$ 
 
 $\therefore f(17) + f(18) + f(19) + f(20) \equiv 77 + 76 + 79 + 0 \pmod{100} \equiv \boxed{32} \pmod{100}$",true,false,0,"If $f(x) = x^{x^{x^x}}$, find the last two digits of $f(17) + f(18) + f(19) + f(20)$.",false

 \[9^2\cdot 6a^2 = [ABC]^2= s(s a)(s b)(s c) = \frac{1}{16}(a+b+63)(a b+63)(a+b 63)( a+b+63)\] 
 Or \[16\cdot 9^2\cdot 6a^2 = (a^2 b^2+126a+63^2)( a^2+b^2+126a 63^2)\] 
 Substituting in our value of $a^2 b^2$ \[16\cdot 9^2\cdot 6a^2 = (126a + 10\cdot 21^2)(126a 10\cdot 21^2) = 126^2a^2 10^2 \cdot 21^4\] Rearranging \[10^2\cdot 21^4 = a^2(126^2 16\cdot 9^2\cdot 6)\] Or \[5^2 7^4 = a^2(7^2 4\cdot 6) = 26a^2\] Thus $a=49$ 
 
 
 Now we note that since $BP\perp AC$ 
 \[CP^2 AP^2 = BC^2 AB^2 \] Thus \[CP^2 = AP^2+BC^2 AB^2 = 57^2+49^2 63^2 = 1681\] Thus $CP=41$ and we are done",true,false,0,"Let $D, E$, and $F$ respectively be the feet of the altitudes from $A, B$, and $C$ of acute triangle $\vartriangle ABC$ such that $AF = 28, FB = 35$ and $BD = 45$.

 $$\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}f(i)\right]=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{E}[f(i)] $$ Since we are interested in avoiding previously present numbers (let us call them colors henceforth) for each of the $2016$ colors we set up another test function $g(j)$ if color $j$ is present in $a_1 \ldots a_{i 1}$ then $g(j)=1$ else $g(j)=0$ Hence we see that $\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=1}^{2016}g(j)\right]$ is the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_{i 1}$ inclusive Note that $\mathbb{E}[g(j)]=1 \left(\frac{2015}{2016}\right)^{i 1}$ since the probability that color $j$ shows up somewhere is one minus the probability that it never shows up at all meaning all of the $i 1$ $a$ ' s are one of the other $2015$ colors Hence by linearity of expectation the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_{i 1}$ (henceforth denoted $C_{i 1}$ ) is $2016 \frac{2015^{i 1}}{2016^{i 2}}$ 
 Now it is time to compute $\mathbb{E}[f(i)]$ Firstly $i$ must be in $S$ (let's call this $i$ is good ) In order for $i$ to avoid previously present colors it must be one of the $2016 C_{i 1}$ colors which occurs with probability $$\frac{2016 C_{i 1}}{2016}=\frac{2015^{i 1}}{2016^{i 1}}$$ (we didn't really need expectation to tell us that ) Suppose that the color of $a_i$ is color $k$ 
 Now given that $i$ is good we must re evaluate the expected number of present colors between $a_1$ and $a_i$ or $C_{i\ \text{given}\ i}$ henceforth denoted as $D_i$ Again $D_i=\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{j=1}^{2016}g(j)_{\text{given }i}\right]=1+\sum_{j\neq k}\mathbb{E}[g(j)]$ since $\mathbb{E}[g(k)]=1$ (we know for sure color $k$ occurs at $a_i$ keep in mind that we also know that color $k$ never appears before $a_i$ ) Note $\mathbb{E}[g(j)]=1 \left(\frac{2014}{2015}\right)^{i 1}$ for $j\neq k$ since $k$ never appears previous to $a_i$ meaning the pool of possible colors decreases by one for $a_1$ through $a_{i 1}$ Then we see $D_i=1+2015\left(1 \left(\frac{2014}{2015}\right)^{i 1}\right)=2016 \frac{2014^{i 1}}{2015^{i 2}}$ In order for $i+1$ to be good $a_{i+1}$ must avoid all these colors which occurs with probability $$\frac{2016 D_i}{2016}=\frac{2014^{i 1}}{2015^{i 2}2016} $$ Hence the probability that both $i$ and $i+1$ are good (and thereby the value of $f(i)$ ) is 
 $$\frac{2015^{i 1}}{2016^{i 1}}\cdot\frac{2015^{i 1}}{2016^{i 1}}=\frac{2015}{2016}\left(\frac{2014}{2016}\right)^{i 1} $$ Summing this from $i=1$ to $\infty$ we see that the desired answer is

 Now we show this is sufficient We proceed by induction on $N$ The base case of $N=4$ is tedious but not hard to check Now for the inductive step assume the proposition for some $N\in\mathbb N$ and consider any graph $G$ on $N+1$ vertices Let $w$ be the vertex in $G$ of smallest degree We now case on the degree of $w$ 
 First suppose that $d = \deg w \leq \tfrac {N+1}2$ and label the vertices in the neighborhood of $w$ by the labels $w_1 \ldots w_d$ Remove $w$ and all edges connecting to $w$ to form a new graph $G'$ By the induction hypothesis $G'$ can be colored in $\lfloor\tfrac{N^2}4\rfloor$ colors Now when adding $w$ back in we may use $d$ new colors (unless $d=0$ in which case we use one new color) where the $k^{\text{th}}$ new color is applied to vertices $w$ and $w_k$ it is clear that this new coloring works As a result we have used at most 
 \[
\left\lfloor\frac{N^2}4\right\rfloor + d \leq \left\lfloor\frac{N^2}4\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{N+1}2\right\rfloor \leq \left\lfloor\frac{(N+1)^2}4\right\rfloor 
\] colors and so this case is satisfied Now suppose that $d > \tfrac{N+1}2$ and consider the graph $G_0$ formed by only the edges connecting two elements in $w \cup N(w)$ The crucial claim is that there are at most $\tfrac{N+1}2$ connected components in this graph It is sufficient to show that the degree of each vertex in this graph is at least $1$ for then each connected component has size at least $2$ To prove this let $w\in V(G_0)$ be arbitrary and consider the neighborhood $N(w)$ of $w$ in $G$ If for the sake of contradiction $N(w)\cap N(v)=\varnothing$ then we obtain the inequality 
 \[
N+1 \geq |N(v)\cup N(w)|\geq |N(v)| + |N(w)| > \frac{N+1}2 + \frac{N+1}2 = N+1 \] contradiction Hence $v$ and $w$ share a common neighbor $v'$ and so $\{w v'\}\in E(G_0)$ As a result when doing the same inductive process as in the first case we can add at most $\lfloor\tfrac{N+1}2\rfloor$ colors one for each connected component in $G_0$ We have exhausted both cases and so by the Principle of Mathematical Induction we're done",true,false,1,"We say that the prime numbers $p_1,\dots,p_n$ construct the graph $G$ if we can assign to each vertex of $G$ a natural number whose prime divisors are among $p_1,\dots,p_n$ and there is an edge between two vertices in $G$ if and only if the numbers assigned to the two vertices have a common divisor greater than $1$.

 For part (a) I claim that $i = 512$ works (this is also minimal) $(x+x^{ 1}+1)^{512} = x^{512}+x^{ 512}+1 = x^{512}+x^{512}+1 = 1 \pmod{x^{1024} 1}$ (This just follows from $(x+y)^{2^k} \equiv x^{2^k}+y^{2^k} \pmod{2}$ 
 
 For part (b) $n$ works iff $3 \not| n$ If $3|n$ since $x+x^{ 1}+1 | x^n 1$ it will never return to $1$ since all terms after the first one won't be relatively prime with the modulus so they can't be 1 Otherwise since there are only finitely many polynomials in $\mathbb{F}_2[x] \pmod{x^n 1}$ eventually $(x+x^{ 1}+1)^m = (x+x^{ 1}+1)^{m_1}$ for some $m < m_1$ Since $\gcd(x+x^{ 1}+1 x^n 1) = 1$ we can divide through by $(x+x^{ 1}+1)^m$ to get that $(x+x^{ 1}+1)^{m_1 m} = 1$ Therefore it returns to 1 and the sequence will repeat",true,false,1,"There are $n$ coins lying in a circle.

 So our sequence goes (after reducing $\pmod{2\pi}$ and starting from $\psi(3)$ ) \[2\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{9\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{27\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{17\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{19\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{25\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{11\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right) 2\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{16}\right) \ldots\] 
 
 In particular it repeats every 8 terms As an added bonus note the first four terms have the same product as the next 4 terms (since $\cos(x) = \cos(x+\pi)$ ) So we just need to find $2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{9\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{27\pi}{16}\right)$ and take it to the 25th power Simple trig identities do the job $2\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{9\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{27\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{17\pi}{16}\right) = 2\cos\left(\frac{3\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{16}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{16}\right) = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \cdot 2\sin\left(\frac{3\pi}{8}\right) = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) \cdot 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = 2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sqrt{2}$

 Note that $5^n\cdot 2^n = 10^n$ and let $\overline{ab}=n$ 
 
 So for some positive integer $x y$ we have $10^x\cdot n < 2^n < 10^x \cdot(n+1) 10^y\cdot n < 5^n < 10^y \cdot (n+1)$ Multiplying the two relations yields $10^{x+y} n^2 < 10^n < 10^{x+y} (n+1)^2$ 
 
 If we denote $s_1 s_2$ to be the number of digits of $2^n 5^n$ respectively then we have that $s_1=x+2 s_2=y+2$ Note that $10^{s_1 1}<2^n < 10^{s_1} 10^{s_2 1}<5^n<10^{s_2}$ So we have $10^{s_1+s_2 2}<10^n<10^{s_1+s_2} \Longrightarrow n= s_1+s_2 1=x+y+3$ 
 
 Going back to the original inequality plugging $n=x+y+3$ in yields $10^{x+y}n^2<10^{x+y+3}<10^{x+y}(n+1)^2 \Longrightarrow n^2<1000<(n+1)^2$ The only positive integer $n$ satisfying this is $\boxed{n=31}$ 
 
 
 An intuitive way to think about it is to note that since $2^n\cdot 5^n=10^n$ and they have the same two leftmost digits then these two digits have to be the first two digits of $\sqrt{10}\approx 3 16227766$ so $\boxed{31}$ Similarly you can show that in general if $2^n 5^n$ share the leftmost $k$ digits then these $k$ digits will be the leftmost $k$ digits of $\sqrt{10}$",true,false,0,"Suppose that for some positive integer $n$, the first two digits of $5^n$ and $2^n$ are identical.

 $ \sigma(2^k) = \sum_{i = 0}^k 2^i = 2^{k + 1} 1$ so $ \phi(2^{k + 1} 1) = 2^k$ Suppose $ 2^{k + 1} 1 = \prod_{i = 1}^m p_i^{e_i}$ then $ 2^k = \phi(2^{k + 1} 1) = (2^{k + 1} 1)\prod_{i = 1}^m \left(\frac {p_i 1}{p_i}\right)$ Since $ 2^k$ has no odd factors it follows that $ \prod_{i = 1}^m p_i \ge 2^{k + 1} 1$ but by definition $ \prod_{i = 1}^m p_i \le 2^{k + 1} 1$ so $ \prod_{i = 1}^m p_i = 2^{k + 1} 1$ Then $ 2^k = \prod_{i = 1}^m (p_i 1)$ so it follows that $ p_i = 2^{j_i} + 1$ for integers $ j_i$ and 
 \[ \prod_{i = 1}^m (2^{j_i} + 1) = 2^{k + 1} 1 \] 
 Because $ 2^{j_i + 1}$ is prime $ j_i$ cannot have any odd factors so $ j_i = 2^{l_i}$ for integers $ l_i$ Multiplying both sides by $ \prod_{i = 1}^{m} (2^{2^{l_i}} 1)$ gives 
 \[ \prod_{i = 1}^m (2^{2^{l_i + 1}} 1) = (2^{k + 1} 1)\prod_{i = 1}^m (2^{2^{l_i}} 1) \] 
 Thus $ \text{gcd}\ \left(2^{2^{l_i}} 1 2^{k + 1} 1\right) \neq 1$ for some $ i$ By the Euclidean Algorithm this is true iff $ k$ is a multiple of $ 2^{l_i}$ or vice versa and $ k + 1$ has no odd prime factors (otherwise it divides out if $ l$ is odd and $ l|k + 1$ then $ 2^l 1|2^{k + 1} 1$ but by Euclidean Algorithm $ \text{gcd}\ \left(2^{2^{l_i}} 1 2^{l} 1\right) = 1$ for all $ i$ giving us an extraneous prime factor) so $ k = 2^r 1$ for some $ r$ 
 
 If $ k + 1 = 2^r$ then $ 2^{2^i} + 1|2^{k + 1} 1$ and $ \text{gcd}\ \left(2^{2^i} + 1 2^{2^j} + 1\right) = 1$ for $ 0 \le i j \le r 1$ and expanding the last expression and using a telescoping difference of squares product gives 
 \[ \left[\frac {1}{2^1 1}\right] \cdot (2^{k + 1} 1)\prod_{i = 0}^{r 1} \left(\frac {2^{2^i}}{2^{2^i} + 1}\right) = 2^{2^r 1} = 2^{k} \]

 This problem was surprisingly difficult It took me a really long time to figure out how to get integrals that actually converged There are many different expressions that you can come up with to represent the same areas and many different limits of integration you can choose but only one combination of all these formulas and limits of integration leads to convergence I'm still not 100% sure why it should actually matter which order you integrate in but anyway here goes We choose $A = (x_a y_a)$ randomly in the square and draw the line from $(0 0)$ to $A$ The equation of this line is $L_1 y = \frac{y_a}{x_a}x$ 
 
 Next we draw the line passing through points $(1 0)$ and $A$ The equation of this line is $L_2 y = \frac{y_a}{1 x_a}(1 x)$ 
 
 For a fixed $A$ the line segment from any other point $B$ to $(1 0)$ will intersect with $L_1$ if and only if $B$ is in the interior of the region bounded on the right by the lines $L_1$ $L_2$ and on the left by the edge of the square Thus for a fixed $A$ the probability of choosing such a $B$ is given by the area under this region We need to consider two cases Case 1 When $y < 1 x$ this region is a simple triangle whose base is on the $y$ axis The length of the base is given by $\frac{y_a}{1 x_a}$ and the height of the triangle is given simply by $x_a$ Hence the area of this triangle is given by $\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{x_a y_a}{1 x_a}$ To find the total probability for all possible choices of $A$ we integrate over the lower left portion of the unit square This is given by $P_1 = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{1 x} \frac{y x}{1 x} dy dx$ 
 
 $= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1} \frac{x}{1 x} \left[\frac{y^2}{2}\right]^{1 x}_{0} dx$ 
 
 $= \frac{1}{4}\int_{0}^{1} x(1 x) dx$ 
 
 $= \frac{1}{24}$ 
 
 Note that the order of integration here is important If we integrate with respect to $x_a$ first we will get an expression involving a logarithm which will diverge over the limits of integration But by integrating with respect to $y_a$ first the denominators cancel out Case 2 When $y > 1 x$ the problem is more difficult because the shape of the region is a trapezoid instead of a triangle First let $K$ be the point of intersection of $L_1$ and the line $y=1$ and note that $K = \left(\frac{x_a}{y_a} 1\right)$ Let $J$ be the point of intersection of $L_2$ and the line $y=1$ and we calculate $J = \left(1 \frac{1 x_a}{y_a} 1\right)$ Also let $O$ be the origin and $P = (0 1)$ The region we are trying to find the area of is trapezoid $OPJA$ and is given by the area of triangle $OPK$ minus the area of triangle $KJA$ There are other ways to compute the area of this region as well but they lead to expressions which result in non converging integrals Triangle $KJA$ has base $\frac{x_a}{y_a} \left(1 \frac{1 x_a}{y_a}\right) = \frac{1}{y_a} 1$ and height $1 y_a$ so its area is given by $\frac{1}{2}(1 y_a)\left(\frac{1 y_a}{y_a}\right)$ 
 
 Triangle $OPK$ has base $1$ and height $\frac{x_a}{y_a}$ so its area is given by $\frac{x_a}{2y_a}$ 
 
 Hence the area of region $OPJA$ is given by $\frac{x_a}{2y_a} \frac{(1 y_a)^2}{2y_a}$ 
 
 
 Here we need to integrate over the upper right half of the unit square which is given by $P_2 = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{y}\int_{1 y}^{1} x (1 y)^2 dx dy$ 
 
 Here notice that we have changed the order of integration from the previous region for the same reason that we need to integrate first with respect to whichever variable will not yield a logarithm $= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{y} \left[\frac{x^2}{2} (1 y)^2 x\right]_{1 y}^{1} dy$ 
 
 $= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{1}{y} \left[\frac{1}{2} (1 y)^2 \frac{(1 y)^2}{2} + (1 y)^3\right] dy$ 
 
 $= \frac{1}{4}\int_{0}^{1}3y 2y^2 dy$ 
 
 $= \frac{1}{4}\left[\frac{3y^2}{2} \frac{2y^3}{3}\right]_0^1$

 Claim 2 $f(1) = 2000$ 
 
 Proof $f(1)$ is simply the sum of all possible $k$ Notice that $\gcd(k 100) = 1$ iff $\gcd(k 2) = 1$ and $\gcd(k 5) = 1$ We find the sum of all multiples of 2 or 5 less than or equal to 100 like so \begin{align*}
s = & (2 + 4 + \dots + 100) + (5 + 10 + \dots + 100) (10 + 20 + \dots + 100) \\
= & 2 \cdot 1275 + 5 \cdot 210 10 \cdot 55 = 3050
\end{align*} 
 And so $f(1) = (1 + 2 + \dots + 100) s = 5050 3050 = 2000$ $\blacksquare$ 
 
 Claim 3 $f(l) = f(1) = 2000$ for any $l$ coprime to 100 Proof Notice that for any $l$ coprime to 100 $\sigma(l) \equiv kl \pmod{100}$ must be coprime to 100 as well Let us say $k_1l \equiv k_2l \pmod{100}$ for some $k_1 k_2$ coprime to and less than 100 Then we have $(k_1 k_2)l \equiv 0 \pmod{100}$ $l \equiv 0 \pmod{100}$ is impossible so we must have $k_1 k_2 \equiv 0 \pmod{100} \implies k_1 = k_2$ Therefore $\sigma(l)$ is distinct for each $k$ and since $\sigma(l)$ must be coprime to 100 as well the possible values for $\sigma(l)$ are simply the possible values for $k$ i e $f(l) = f(1) = 2000$ $\blacksquare$ 
 
 Claim 4 $f(n) \le 2000$ for any $n$ 
 
 Proof We have already proven this for $n$ coprime to 100 so we will assume $\gcd(n 100) \ne 1$ Let $m = \gcd(n 100)$ Then we have $n = mn'$ where $\gcd(n' 100) = 1$ Let $g = \frac{100}{m}$ Let us consider all $x \le g$ such that $x$ is coprime to 100 If we let $x' = x + yg$ for any integer $0 \le y \le m 1$ we know $x'$ is coprime to 100 as well and $nx \equiv mn'x \equiv mn'(x + yg) \equiv mn'x' \pmod{100}$ Therefore if two different values of $\sigma(1)$ are congruent mod $g$ then $\sigma(n)$ in each case will be equal so we need only consider $\sigma(1) \in \{1 2 \dots g\}$ Finally we have 
 
 \begin{align*}
f(n) &= \sum_{i = 1 \ \gcd(i 100) = 1}^g (i \cdot n\bmod{100}) \le \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i = 1 \ \gcd(i 100) = 1}^{100} (i \cdot m \cdot n' \bmod{100}) \\
&\le \frac{1}{m} \cdot m \sum_{i = 1 \ \gcd(i 100) = 1}^{100} (i \cdot n' \bmod{100}) = \sum_{i = 1 \ \gcd(i 100) = 1}^{100} (i \cdot n' \bmod{100}) = 2000
\end{align*} 
 because $n'$ is coprime to 100 $\blacksquare$ 
 
 Claim 5 $f(n) \ge 50$ for any $n$ 
 
 First we verify that this is achievable We know that $k = \sigma(1)$ must be odd so $\sigma(50) = 50\sigma(1) \bmod 100 = 50(2l + 1) \bmod 100 = 50$ for any possible value of $k$ and so $f(50) = 50$ 
 
 Next we show that this is optimal Say there exists some $n$ such that $\sigma(n)$ can be $p_1 p_2 p_3 \dots$ such that $\sum_i p_i < 50$ Clearly $p_i < 50$ as well If we define $m$ $g$ and $y$ as before we have that $p_i + yg \bmod 100$ must also be a valid $p$ We have either $g = 100$ or $g \mid 50$ The first case is only possible when $n$ is coprime to 100 and we have shown $f(n) = 2000$ in this case so we do not need to consider it In the second case there exists some integer $y$ such that $yg = 50$ and we can simply take some $p$ and add $yg$ to get another $p$ greater than 50 contradiction Therefore the minimum value of $f(n)$ is 50 $\blacksquare$

 Claim 1 $r(m) = \phi(m)(\sum_{i a_i > 1} \frac{1}{p_i} + \sum_{i a_i = 1} \frac{1}{1 p_i})$ 
 
 Proof Let us take some $b < m$ such that $\gcd(b m) = p_i$ Let $b = p_ib'$ and $m = p_im'$ so $\gcd(b' m') = 1$ Clearly the number of possible values for $b'$ given $p_i$ is $\phi(m') = \phi(\frac{m}{p_i})$ If $a_i$ is 1 then this becomes 
 
 $$\frac{m}{p_i} \cdot \frac{(1 \frac{1}{p_1})(1 \frac{1}{p_2})(\dots)}{1 \frac{1}{p_i}} = \frac{\phi(m)}{p_i(1 \frac{1}{p_i})} = \frac{\phi(m)}{p_i 1}$$ 
 
 If $a_i > 1$ this becomes 
 
 $$\frac{m}{p_i} \cdot (1 \frac{1}{p_1})(1 \frac{1}{p_2})(\dots) = \frac{\phi(m)}{p_i}$$ 
 Summing over all $p_i$ (there is no overcounting because the gcd can only be one prime) we get $r(m) = \phi(m)(\sum_{i a_i > 1} \frac{1}{p_i} + \sum_{i a_i = 1} \frac{1}{1 p_i})$ $\blacksquare$ 
 
 So we have $\phi(m) = r(m) = \phi(m)(\sum_{i a_i > 1} \frac{1}{p_i} + \sum_{i a_i = 1} \frac{1}{1 p_i}) \implies \sum_{i a_i > 1} \frac{1}{p_i} + \sum_{i a_i = 1} \frac{1}{1 p_i} = 1$ Notice that $m$ can be composed of no more than 4 distinct primes as $2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 > 300$ Additionally if 2 is not a factor of $m$ then it can be composed of no more than 3 distinct primes as $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 > 300$ 
 
 Thus we need to find sequences of unit fractions $\frac{1}{n_1} \frac{1}{n_2} \dots \frac{1}{n_i}$ that sum up to 1 ( $i \le 4$ ) WLOG say $n_{j + 1} \ge n_j$ (statement 1) First let us find sequences for $i = 1$ The only such sequence is $\frac{1}{1}$ so we need $p_1 = 1$ and $a_1 > 1$ or $p_1 1 = 1 \implies p_1 = 2$ and $a_1 = 1$ The first case is invalid because 1 isn't a prime but the second case is valid so $m = 2$ is a possible solution Let us assume $\frac{1}{2}$ isn't in a sequence with $i > 1$ Then the maximum value for the sum is $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 1$ (as 3 is the next prime after 2 and there can only be up to 3 primes if 2 isn't a factor) Clearly this sequence is invalid because we may have $p_1 = 3$ and $p_2 1 = 3$ but we can't find a value for $p_3$ without repeating a prime Any other sequence following statement 1 and not including $\frac{1}{2}$ must have a sum less than 1 Therefore $\frac{1}{2}$ must be in the sequence i e $n_1 = 2$ 
 
 For $i = 2$ The only such sequence is $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}$ We have $p_1 = 2$ $a_1 > 1$ $p_2 1 = 2 \implies p_2 = 3$ $a_2 = 1$ Therefore we have $m = 2^k \cdot 3$ $k > 1$ which is the same as $m = 2^{k'} \cdot 12$ $k' \ge 0$ We see that $m = 2^{k'} \cdot 12 < 300$ implies $2^{k'} < 25$ so $k' \le 4$ Finding the sum of all $m$ of this form we find $12(2^0 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^4) = 372$ 
 
 For $i = 3$ The only such sequences are $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6}$ The first sequence is invalid because it requires some $p_i = 4$ but 4 isn't prime The second sequence works and it implies $p_1 = 2 a_1 > 1 p_2 = 3 a_2 > 1 p_3 = 7 a_3 = 1$ If we take the minimum possible $m$ of this form we get $m = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 7 = 252$ Multiplying by 2 or 3 would exceed the bound of 300 so 252 is the only solution of this form For $i = 4$ Notice that $\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = 1$ so we must have $n_2 \le 6$ (otherwise the sum would be less than 1) Clearly $n_2 \ge 3$ as well (because if $n_2$ were 2 the sum would be greater than 1) Then we can find all such sequences for each possible value of $n_2$ and see that none of them are valid Therefore the sum of all possible $m$ is $2 + 372 + 252 = \fbox{626}$",true,false,0,"Let $r(m)$ be the number of positive integers a less than or equal to $m$ where $\gcd(a, m)$ is prime.

 Therefore for $\tbinom{1515}{x}$ to be odd we need $a_{9}=a_4 = a_2=0$ (with no restrictions on the other digits in the binary representation of $x$ ) and for $\tbinom{1975}{x}$ to be odd we need $a_6=a_3=0$ (also with no restrictions on the other digits in the binary representation of $x$ ) Putting these together we have $a_9=a_6=a_4=a_3=a_2=0$ and $a_{10} a_8 a_7 a_5 a_1 a_0 \in \{0 1\} $ Now we just need to find the largest such integer less than $1000 $ 
 
 Clearly in order for $x$ to be less than $1000 $ we need $a_{10}=0 $ Then the maximum possible value of $x$ occurs if we let $a_8=a_7=a_5=a_1=a_0=1 $ in which case

 Hint 2 Click to reveal hidden text Catalan numbers! 
 Solution Click to reveal hidden text The Catalan number $C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1}\binom{2n}{n}$ is known to solve many classic combinatorial problems including counting the number of ways to start and end at $0$ from a sequence of $2n$ moves along the nonnegative integer number line (where each move either adds $1$ to or subtracts $1$ from your previous position on the line subtracting $1$ from the position $0$ is disallowed) Any move sequence along an integer number line that starts and ends at the same point must have an even number of moves with half of the moves in one direction and half in the other direction Therefore over all Kelvin's $14$ moves in the grid $(\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\})^2$ there must be some integer $k \in \{0 \ldots 7\}$ such that $k$ of the moves are right $k$ are left $7 k$ are up and $7 k$ are down If we break this $14$ move sequence into the left right subsequence of length $2k$ and the up down subsequence of length $2(7 k)$ then each of these subsequences needs to be a valid instance of the aforementioned number line counting problem for $n = k$ and $n = 7 k$ respectively Conversely for any move sequences $M_1$ and $M_2$ that are valid instances of these respective counting problems and for any $2k$ element subset $S_1$ of $\{1 \ldots 14\}$ we can make a valid $14$ move sequence whose subsequence over the indices in $S_1$ is $M_1$ and whose subsequence over the remaining indices (in $\bar{S_1}$ ) is $M_2$ Hence the answer is 
 $$\sum_{k=0}^{7} \binom{14}{2k}C_kC_{7 k} = 2\sum_{k=0}^{3}\binom{14}{2k}C_kC_{7 k}$$ (this equality holds because the mapping $k \mapsto 7 k$ maps $0 1 2 3$ to $7 6 5 4$ and does not change the value of the summand) Using the formula $C_n = \frac{1}{n + 1}\binom{2n}{n}$ the answer becomes 
 $$2\sum_{k=0}^{3} \frac{14!}{(2k)!(2(7 k))!}\cdot\frac{1}{(k+1)(8 k)}\cdot\frac{(2k)!}{(k!)^2}\cdot\frac{(2(7 k))!}{((7 k)!)^2} = 2\left(\frac{14!}{1\cdot 8\cdot 1^2\cdot (7!)^2} + \frac{14!}{2\cdot 7\cdot 1^2\cdot (6!)^2} + \frac{14!}{3\cdot 6\cdot 2^2\cdot (5!)^2} + \frac{14!}{4\cdot 5\cdot 6^2\cdot (4!)^2}\right) $$ which evaluates to $\boxed{613470}$

 Let $n$ be the length of the string $d = d_1d_2\ldots d_n$ We first show that if $d$ is not primitive then $f(d)$ is necessarily at most $n/2$ By way of contradiction if $2f(d) > n$ then the leftmost and rightmost substrings of $d$ of length $f(d)$ must overlap in the middle Specifically if we let $s$ be the substring $d_1\ldots d_{f(d)}$ and $t$ be the substring $d_{n f(d)+1}\ldots d_n$ then $s$ must equal $t$ so for each $i \in \{n f(d) + 1 \ldots f(d)\}$ we have $s_i = d_i = t_{i (n f(d))} = s_{i (n f(d))}$ Therefore the first $2f(d) n$ digits of $s$ must match the last $2f(d) n$ digits of $s$ so the first $2f(d) n$ digits of $d$ must match the last $2f(d) n$ digits of $d$ Because $d$ is not primitive $f(d) < n$ so $2f(d) n = f(d) + (f(d) n) < f(d)$ so $d$ is a $k$ repeater for $k$ equal to $2f(d) n$ which is less than $f(d)$ this contradicts the definition of $f(d)$ 
 
 For any $n$ and $k$ with $1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2\rfloor$ any $n$ digit string $d$ with $f(d) = k$ can be uniquely generated by picking a unique primitive $k$ digit string $s$ picking a unique $(n 2k)$ digit string $t$ and setting $d = sts$ The number of ways to choose $s$ is $a_k$ and the number of ways to choose $t$ is $3^{n 2k}$ Thus there are $3^{n 2k}a_k$ strings $d$ with $n$ digits with $f(d) = k$ There are $3^n$ total strings $d$ with $n$ digits so the number of primitive $n$ digit strings is 
 $$a_n = 3^n \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} 3^{n 2k}a_k $$ Some easy base cases are $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 3$ We can eliminate the summation from this recurrence relation in several ways Here are a few For $n \geq 2$ observe that 
 $$a_{n 2} = 3^{n 2} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor 1} 3^{n 2 2k}a_k = \frac{1}{9}\left(3^n \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor 1} 3^{n 2k}a_k\right) = \frac{a_n + 3^{n 2\lfloor n/2\rfloor} a_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}{9} $$ so $a_n = 9a_{n 2} 3^{n 2\lfloor n/2\rfloor} a_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}$ In other words when $n$ is even $a_n = 9a_{n 2} a_{n/2}$ and when $n$ is odd $a_n = 9a_{n 2} 3a_{(n 1)/2}$ Also for odd $n$ $\lfloor(n 1)/2\rfloor$ equals $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ so 
 $$a_{n 1} = 3^{n 1} \sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor} 3^{n 1 2k}a_k = \frac{a_n}{3} \implies a_n = 3a_{n 1} $$

 Consider an $n$ tuple of positive integers and consider some maximal element $a_i$ such that $a_{i 1}$ isn't maxima Then we must have $a_i=a_{i 1}+a_{i+1}$ Now suppose we delete $a_i$ I claim the result is $(n 1)$ nice Indeed $a_{i+1} \equiv a_i \pmod{a_{i 1}}$ so $a_{i 1} \mid a_{i 2}+a_i \implies a_{i 1} \mid a_{i 2}+a_{i+1}$ Likewise $a_{i+1} \mid a_{i 1}+a_{i+2}$ Moreover by the Euclidean algorithm we have 
 $$1=\gcd(a_1 \ldots a_{i 1} a_{i 1}+a_{i+1} a_i \ldots a_n)=\gcd(a_1 \ldots a_{i 1} 0 a_{i+1} \ldots a_n)=\gcd(a_1 \ldots a_{i 1} a_{i+1} \ldots a_n) $$ so the claim is true unless no such $i$ exists In this case the $n$ tuple is clearly all $1$ ' s due to the gcd condition (every element is maximal) in which case the claim still holds so it's true in general I now claim that for $n \geq 2$ the maximal element of an $n$ tuple is at most $F_n$ and the second largest element is at most $F_{n 1}$ This follows by induction first off the only good $1$ tuple is $(1)$ so the only good $2$ tuples are $(1 2)$ and $(1 1)$ up to cyclic permutations thus the claim is true for $n=2$ Now if the claim is true for $n$ it immediately follows that the maximal element of a good $(n+1)$ tuple $T$ is at most $F_{n+1}$ since it's the sum of two elements of the $n$ tuple $T'$ obtained by deleting it Furthermore the second largest element of $T$ is still in $T'$ so it's at most $F_n$ 
 
 By successively deleting maximal elements and applying the above claim it follows that the maximum value of $a_1+\cdots+a_n$ is $F_1+\cdots+F_n$ By induction it is easy to show that this equals $F_{n+2} 2$ so we're done $\blacksquare$",true,false,1,"Let $n$ be a positive integer.

 We can find that since $AN$ bisects $\angle{EAF}$ $EA=FA$ so $AN\bot EF$ which means that $AN||KJ$ so it is then becoming $\frac{CN}{CJ}=\frac{CA}{CK}$ 
 
 Assume that $AE=EF=x CD=10 x BE=7 x=2+x x=\frac{5}{2}$ 
 
 We find point $Z$ lies on $AB$ which makes that $EZ||XB$ Since $EZ||CB \triangle{AEZ}\sim \triangle{ACB} AZ=7\cdot \frac{AE}{AC}=\frac{7}{4}$ then we can have that $AF=\frac{5}{2} \frac{7}{4}=\frac{3}{4}$ since $BF=7 \frac{5}{2}=\frac{9}{2} BX=EZ\cdot \frac{BF}{ZF}=18$ 
 
 Since $\triangle{EKX}$ is an isosceles triangle $EK=KX$ we assume that $AK=x KX=\frac{5}{2}+x$

 \[\prod_{\substack{1\le k\le n\\\gcd(k n) = 1}}(x k) \equiv (x 1)^{p 1} \equiv x^{p 1} 1 \pmod{2}\] since $p 1$ is a power of 2 and also

 Proof Suppose $p$ prime divides $n$ Then modulo $p$ 
 \[\prod_{\substack{1\le k\le n\\\gcd(k n) = 1}}(x k) \equiv \prod_{1 \le k \le p 1} (x k)^{\tfrac{\varphi(n)}{p 1}} \equiv (x^{p 1} 1)^{\tfrac{\varphi(n)}{p 1}}\] which is supposed to equal $x^{\varphi(n)} 1$ This only happens when $\tfrac{\varphi(n)}{p 1}$ is a power of $p$ which concludes the proof Claim (Elimination of non prime powers) If $n$ is not a prime power then $n$ is twice a Fermat prime Proof Suppose $p > q$ are two distinct primes dividing $n$ Then $(p 1)(q 1) \mid \varphi(n)$ so $q 1$ is a power of $p$ and $p 1$ is a power of $q$ But $q 1 < p$ so $q 1 = 1$ and $q = 2$ Thus $p = 2^s + 1$ for some $s$ 
 
 This also demonstrates that 2 and $2^s + 1$ are the only prime factors of $n$ so let $n = 2^e (2^s + 1)^f$ Then $\varphi(n) = 2^{e+s 1} (2^s + 1)^{f 1}$ This is supposed to be a power of 2 so $f = 1$ It is also supposed to be $2^s$ times a power of $2^s + 1$ so $e+s 1 = s$ whence $e = 1$ Hence $n = 2(2^s + 1)$ as expected Now only prime power $n$ remain to be dealt with Write $n = p^e$ say with $e \ge 2$ (since we know $e = 1$ works) Then we require 
 \[x^{p^{e 1}(p 1)} 1 \equiv \prod_{\substack{1 \le k \le p^e\\p \nmid k}} (x k) \pmod{n}\] or upon setting $x \mapsto x 1$ 
 \[(x 1)^{p^{e 1}(p 1)} 1 \equiv \prod_{\substack{1 \le k \le p^e\\p \nmid k 1}} (x k) \pmod{n} \] It is clear that $x^2$ does not divide the LHS above However if $e \neq 2$ then the RHS contains the three distinct factors $x$ $x p$ $x p^{e 1}$ which collectively contain a factor of $x^2$ (as $x$ divides $(x p)(x p^{e 1})$ ) 
 
 Thus $e = 2$ Likewise if $p \neq 2$ the RHS contains the three distinct factors $x$ $x p$ $x 2p$ which multiply to a product divisible by $x^2$ contradiction Thus $(p e) = (2 2)$ so $n = 2^2 = 4$ as expected",true,false,0,"Let $\varphi(n)$ denotes the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$.

Proposed by Hari Desikan",,CMIMC 2024 Theoretical Computer Science #3,https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c204707h3306414p30520095,,,2024,2024 TCS Problem 3,positive integer <= 1000,"Context I got 59 points in contest doing this problem all by myself the highest of any team (yes flex) (my greatest accomplishment) (we won TCS overall) 
 
 Most proofs are highly unrigorous given the time limit Outline of my solution in contest including a little bit of my thought process Since I knew everyone else would go for the first two problems I decided to go to this one For the first 50 minutes I completely regretted this decision At first sight the problem looks super intimidating I began by reading the problem Then reading it again Then getting distracted and reading it again After a while (around 20 minutes probably because I kept getting distracted) I was able to understand the notation In fact under the $G(n k r (p_1 \dots p_n))$ I wrote ""num doors num turns num rounds probabilities"" to help me remember the notation better Throughout the problems assume that any provided constructions for probabilities can be permuted by symmetry I began with the first subproblem (3 points) Show that $G(3 1 1 (p_1 p_2 p_3))$ can be less than $1$ For this I tested a few probabilities and came to the following lemma When opening two doors with probabilities $p$ and $q$ the unopened door will get weighted by a factor of $2$ In other words the remaining probabilities will be $0 2p$ or $0 2q$ scaled so that the sum of all the probabilities is still $1$ This is easy to prove by conditional probability concepts This is sufficient to solve this problem and (iirc) the example I came up with was $\left(\frac12 \frac13 \frac16\right)$ 
 
 The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(n n 2 1 (p_1 \dots p_n))$ can be less than $1$ for all $n \geq 3$ 
 
 For this I made the following claim Claim It is always optimal to open the doors with the smallest probabilities The reason for this is because if we want to maximize $F$ then we need all the probabilities to be as close to each other as possible In my proof I didn't really account for the case where we might want to make them farther apart temporarily then make them closer later However I assumed that this would just be a simple yet annoying edge case check so I didn't mention it At this point I realized that the problem would be simplest if after combining two doors the sum of the probabilities remained the same This would imply that the doors combined must have the same probability This gave me the idea for the following solution We can simply take the probabilities $\left(\frac 12 \frac 13 \frac 16 \frac 1{12} \dots \frac{1}{6\cdot 2^{n 2}} \frac{1}{6\cdot 2^{n 2}}\right)$ and combining the smallest two probabilities will collapse into a case with $n \mapsto n 1$ since the sum of all the probabilities remains the same The next subproblem (3 points) was to show that $G(3 1 1 (p_1 p_2 p_3))$ can be $1$ This is easy to do with $\left(\frac12 \frac14 \frac14\right)$ 
 
 The next subproblem (10 points) is to show that there exists a tuple $(n k 1 (p_1 \dots p_n))$ with $n>2024 k>506$ such that for all increasing $k'$ from $1$ to $k$ increases $G(n k' 1 (p_1 \dots p_n))$ and the value is $1$ when $k'=k$ 
 
 For this I simply noted that when the probabilities are $\left(\frac12 \frac14 \dots \frac1{2^{n 1}} \frac1{2^{n 1}}\right)$ and there are no more turns then the final score is $\frac{n}{2^{n 1}}$ Since each turn decreases $n$ we can simply take this set of probabilities for sufficiently large $n > k > 2025$ This is because the probability increases as $n$ increases until we reach $n=2$ 
 
 At this point I tried to get some of my team members to help me to no avail Three of them were working on the problem one construction two on the bound and two more were working on problem 2 The next subproblem (6 points) Determine when $G(4 k r (p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4)) = r$ 
 
 I immediately thought to do casework on $r$ we are given that $rk+1 < n$ Therefore we check when $r=2$ so $k=1$ Then we require that after $1$ turn the probabilities are all equal and after another turn the probabilities are once again all equal However in one turn the probabilities $\left(\frac13 \frac13 \frac13\right)$ can only be turned into $\left(\frac13 \frac23\right)$ 
 
 Therefore we must instead have $r=1$ The set of probabilities which can be reduced to $\left(\frac13 \frac13 \frac13\right)$ in exactly one move consists only of $\left(\frac13 \frac13 \frac16 \frac16\right)$ Note that in this case $k$ can be either $1$ or $2$ To reduce to $\left(\frac12 \frac12\right)$ in exactly two moves we must have $\left(\frac12 \frac14 \frac18 \frac18\right)$ and $k=2$ 
 
 Now we continue to the problem of showing when $G(n k r (p_1 \dots p_n)) = r$ The points are as follows 5 points for $k=1$ 
 10 points for $k=2 r=1$ 
 20 points for $r=1$ with exactly $k$ turns per round 
 35 points for $r=1$ 
 55 points for $r=1 2$ 
 75 points for a full solution 
 
 When I saw these scoring guidelines I only had around 15 minutes left I first tried $k=1$ thinking that the lack of a restriction on $r$ is strange Of course it turns out this case is trivial I quickly realized $r$ must be $1$ simply because you cannot go from one position of all equal probabilities to another position of all equal probabilities in one turn I then decided to try $r=1$ My conjecture for this based on previous problems is simply to modify the power of $2$ strategy from the $n=4$ case However I did not really provide a specific proof for this Specifically we could have some amount of equal probabilities then use the dividing by $2$ strategy constantly I here quickly realized that the 20 point case is isomorphic to the 35 point case because we can simply just take all the values of $k$ bigger than the exact number of turns necessary Anyways it took me 10 very unfortunate minutes to actually calculate the annoying values and indices Eventually the probabilities which can be collapsed into an all equal case in exactly $k$ turns is 
 
 \[
\left(
\frac{1}{n k+1} \frac{1}{n k+1} \dots \frac{1}{n k+1} \frac{1}{(n k+1)2} \frac{1}{(n k+1)2^2} \dots \frac{1}{(n k+1)2^{k}} \frac{1}{(n k+1)2^{k}}
\right)
\] where $\frac{1}{n k+1}$ occurs $n k$ times Then for the 35 point case we can simply take anything larger than this $k$ as the new $k$ value to produce a valid tuple Once I did this I had around 5 minutes left but instead of trying to prove my unproven lemmas I wondered how it would be possible to go from one set of equal probabilities to another smaller set thereby giving an $r=2$ solution I came to the conclusion that the only way this is possible is if the $n k+1$ in the previous problem is even and we can combine pairs to form another equal configuration I was definitely unable to support this conclusion with any proof but nonetheless I wrote up my thoughts Clearly if this is true the general solution is much the same as $r=2$ 
 
 We start with a configuration such as the tuple mentioned above and it suffices that $2^r$ divides $n k+1$ However in the contest I only had time to writeup my ideas for extending to $r=2$ I said that $n k+1$ would have to be even and we could combine in pairs and with no time remaining added that ""It is easy to extend this idea to larger $r$ "" 
 
 If I ever decide to prove many of these claims rigorously I will definitely return",true,false,1,"In this problem, we explore a variant of the Monty Hall Problem. There are $n$ doors numbered $1, \dots, n$. A single gold coin is placed randomly behind one of the doors, with the probability it is placed behind door $i$ equalling $p_i.$ There are $r$ ""rounds"" in which we may make at most $k$ ""turns"" each, defined as follows: During a ""turn"", you pick two doors and send them to the game host. Then, the host picks one of the two doors in the following manner: If neither door contains the coin, the host randomly picks one with equal probability. If one of the doors contains the coin, the host picks the door which does not have the coin. The host reveals that the picked door does not contain the coin, and opens it. A ""round"" consists of Alice performing at least 1 and at most $k$ turns. After all the turns in round $j$ are complete, suppose there are $d_j$ doors remaining. Bob will compute the probability of each individual door containing the coin. Let $m_j$ be the minimum of these probabilities computed during the $j$th round. Then, Bob awards Alice $d_jm_j$ points. Note that Bob will pay Alice $r$ times, and Alice's total payout is the sum of the $r$ individual payouts. Note that opened doors remain revealed between rounds.

 $\frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \dots a_{13}!}$ ways to arrange the cards between the jokers and $\frac{(53 S)!}{(4 a_1)! (4 a_2)! \dots (4 a_{13})!}$ ways to arrange the rest of the cards since we may consider all cards between the jokers inclusive as one big card (to make $53 S$ total cards with $4 a_1$ $1$ ' s $4 a_2$ $2$ ' s and so on) Furthermore there are a total of $\frac{54!}{4!^{13} \cdot 2}$ ways to arrange the cards Hence if 
 \[ f(x y) = \frac{4!^{13} \cdot 2}{54!} \sum_{0 \le a_1 a_2 \dots a_{13} \le 4} \frac{S!}{a_1! a_2! \dots a_{13}!} \cdot \frac{(53 S)!}{(4 a_1)! (4 a_2)! \dots (4 a_{13})!} x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots +13a_{13}} \] then the answer is the sum of the coefficients of the terms with exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ (the exponent of $x$ doesn't matter) We can rewrite this as 
 \begin{align*} 
 f(x y) &= \frac{4!^{13} \cdot 2}{54!} \sum_{0 \le a_1 a_2 \dots a_{13} \le 4} \frac{53!}{\binom{53}S} \cdot \frac1{4!^{13}} \binom{4}{a_1} \binom{4}{a_2} \dots \binom{4}{a_{13}} x^S y^{a_1 + 2a_2 + \dots +13a_{13}} \\
&= \frac1{27} \sum_{0 \le a_1 a_2 \dots a_{13} \le 4} \frac{x^S}{\binom{53}S} \binom{4}{a_1} \left(y^1 \right)^{a_1} \cdot \binom{4}{a_2} \left(y^2 \right)^{a_2} \cdot \dots \cdot \binom{4}{a_{13}} \left(y^{13} \right)^{a_{13}} \end{align*} Thus if 
 \[g(x y) = \frac1{27} \left( \sum_{a_1=0}^4 x \binom{4}{a_1} y^1 \right) \left( \sum_{a_2=0}^4 x \binom{4}{a_2} y^2 \right) \dots \left( \sum_{a_{13}=0}^4 x \binom{4}{a_{13}} y^{13} \right) = \frac1{27}(1+xy)^4 (1+xy^2)^4 \dots (1+xy^{13})^4\] then $g$ has the same terms as $f$ except with each power of $x$ of the form $x^S$ having a coefficient $\binom{53}{S}$ times larger Now treating $g$ like a polynomial in $y$ alone we can compute the sum of the coefficients of the terms with an exponent of $y$ divisible by $13$ to obtain a polynomial in $x$ then change each term of the form $x^S$ to $\frac1{\binom{53}{S}}$ to obtain our answer This is pretty easy with the root of unity filter let $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 13}$ Then the desired polynomial in $x$ is 
 \[ h(x) = \frac{g(x 1) + g(x \omega) + \dots + g(x \omega^{12})}{13} \] For any primitive $13$ t h root of unity $\zeta$ $1 \zeta^2 \dots \zeta^{12}$ covers all possible roots of unity so 
 \begin{align*} 
 g(x \zeta) &= \frac1{27} ((1+x\zeta) (1+x\zeta^2) \dots (1+x\zeta^{13}))^4 \\
 &= \frac1{27} \left( x^{13} \left( \frac1x \zeta\right) \left( \frac1x \zeta^2\right) \dots \left( \frac1x \zeta^{13}\right) \right)^4 \\
 &= \frac1{27} \left( x^{13} \left(\left( \frac1x\right)^{13} 1\right) \right)^4 \\
 &= \frac1{27} (x^{13} + 1)^4 \end{align*} But $13$ is prime so all such $\omega^k$ with $0<k<13$ are primitive hence 
 \[ h(x) = \frac{g(x 1) + 12 g(x \omega)}{13} = \frac1{13} \left(\frac{(1+x)^{52}}{27} + 12 \cdot \frac{(x^{13} + 1)^4}{27} \right) \] Now it suffices to change each $x^S$ to $\frac1{\binom{53}{S}}$ and sum the resulting expression For the first term each monomial is of the form $\frac1{13 \cdot 27} \binom{52}{S} x^S$ hence each monomial contributes 
 \[ \frac1{13 \cdot 27} \cdot \frac{\binom{52}{S}}{\binom{53}{S}} = \frac1{13 \cdot 27} \cdot \frac{52! \cdot S! \cdot (53 S)!}{53! \cdot S! \cdot (52 S)!} = \frac{53 S}{13 \cdot 27 \cdot 53} \] Summing from $S = 0$ to $52$ this contributes a total of $\frac1{13 \cdot 27 \cdot 53} \cdot \frac{53 \cdot 54}{2} = \frac1{13}$ 
 
 Now for the second term we can expand normally to find that the expression is 
 \[ \frac{12}{13 \cdot 27} \left( 1 + 4x^{13} + 6x^{26} + 4x^{39} + x^{52} \right) \] Ignoring the constant at the front the first and the last monomial give $1$ and $\frac1{53}$ respectively while the middle three contribute less than $\frac{9}{\binom{53}{12}} \ll 10^{ 9}$ (not enough) hence the answer is 
 \[ \frac1{13} + \frac{12}{13 \cdot 27} \left(1 + \frac1{53} \right) = \frac1{13} + \frac{12}{13 \cdot 27} \cdot \frac{54}{53} = \frac{53 + 24}{689} = \frac{77}{689} \]",true,false,0,"Daniel has a (mostly) standard deck of 54 cards, consisting of 4 suits each containing the ranks 1 to 13 as well as 2 jokers.

 Let $1 2 3 \ldots 36$ be the players where a higher number represents a higher skill level I'll use the notation $i j$ to denote the match where $i$ plays $j$ The key is to notice that only the matches of the form $k (k+1)$ matter (ie $1 2$ $2 3$ etc) This is because if we play all matches (excluding $1 2$ ) involving $1$ and $2$ we still won't know who is better between the two players The rest is just computation Obviously the minimum number of slips needed is $35$ and the maximum is ${36\choose 2} = 630$ If we need $n$ slips to determine the order then we need the $35$ different $k (k+1)$ slips to be drawn as well as $n 35$ ""extra"" slips There are ${595\choose {n 35}}$ ways to choose these extra slips Next we fix the last slip to be drawn as one of the $k (k+1)$ slips There are $35$ ways to do this Finally we simply rearrange the remaining $34$ $k (k+1)$ slips and the $n 35$ extra slips There are $(n 1)!$ ways to rearrange these slips In all there are $35{595\choose {n 35}}(n 1)!$ ways to rearrange/pick the slips in order for $n$ slips to determine the order Each one orderings of these has a $$\frac 1{630}\cdot \frac{1}{629}\cdots \frac{1}{631 n}$$ probability of occurring so the probability that $n$ slips determine the order is $$\frac1{630}\cdot \frac{1}{629}\cdots \frac{1}{631 n} \cdot 35{595\choose {n 35}}(n 1)!$$

But what if there is no (odd odd) point? We claim every column has even height then If $i$ is odd then $a_i$ must be even so even height If $i$ is even even columns cannot have odd height since then we must go horizontal by 1 to the next column which means the next column has an (odd odd) point!

 As an extension $\pi(8) \pi(4)$ must be an integral multiple of $4$ Since $9 1=8$ we need either $|\pi(8) \pi(4)|=4$ or $|\pi(8) \pi(4)|=8 $ 
 Note that $\pi(3)\equiv\pi(6)\equiv\pi(9)\pmod 3$ This in particular means that \[\{\pi(3) \pi(6) \pi(9)\}\in\{\{1 4 7\} \{2 5 8\} \{3 6 9\}\} \] Subject to all these conditions a solution exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem on the moduli $5$ $7$ $8$ and $9$ 
 
 We now have enough information to start counting We split the calculation into two cases $\textbf{CASE 1 }\pi(2k)\equiv 0\pmod 2$ $\forall k$ In this case remark that $\{\pi(4) \pi(8)\}$ can only be one of $\{2 6\}$ or $\{4 8\}$ Noting the third bullet point above we see that in the former case we must have $\pi(6)=4$ in the latter case we must have $\pi(6)=6$ (why?) From these $\pi(2)$ is uniquely determined and there are two ways to choose the ordered pair $(\pi(3) \pi(9))$ Thus in total there are $2\times 2\times 2=8$ possibilities in this case $\textbf{CASE 2 }\pi(2k)\equiv 1\pmod 2$ $\forall k$ In this case there are more choices for the set $\{\pi(4) \pi(8)\}$ In fact there are four $\{1 5\}$ $\{3 7\}$ $\{5 9\}$ and $\{1 9\}$ Because of this we need to be more careful about how we enumerate the possible permutations which work We again split into two cases $\textbf{SUBCASE 1 }\{\pi(4) \pi(8)\} = \{1 5\}$ or $\{5 9\}$ Note that in these cases there are two possible values of $\pi(6)$ in the first one $\pi(6)\in\{3 9\}$ while in the second $\pi(6)\in\{1 7\}$ Regardless of which member of which set is chosen the other element in the set must also appear as some other element in $\{\pi(3) \pi(9)\}$ For example if $\pi(6)=1$ then either $\pi(3)=7$ or $\pi(9)=7$ Combining this with the fact that all $\pi(2k)$ have the same parity we see that $\pi(2)$ is actually fixed in these situations Thus for each of the four possibilities for $(\pi(4) \pi(8))$ there are two possible values of $\pi(6)$ and two possibilities for $(\pi(3) \pi(9))$ for $16$ different permutations which work $\textbf{SUBCASE 2 }\{\pi(4) \pi(8)\} = \{3 7\}$ or $\{1 9\}$ In contrast with the above note that in these two cases $\pi(6)$ is fixed which means there the value of $\pi(2)$ can vary More specifically for each of the four possibilities for $(\pi(4) \pi(8))$ there are two possible values for $\pi(2)$ and two possibilities for $(\pi(3) \pi(9))$ for $16$ different permutations which work Thus in this total case $32$ systems are possible Finally there are three numbers left and they can be assigned to $\pi(1)$ $\pi(5)$ and $\pi(7)$ in $3!=6$ ways Thus the total number of consistent systems is $6(8+32)=\boxed{240}$",true,false,0,"For how many permutations $\pi$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,9\}$ does there exist an integer $N$ such that \[N\equiv \pi(i)\pmod{i}\text{ for all integers }1\leq i\leq 9?\]",false

 Solution We first make use of a lemma LEMMA Let $F(v)$ be a linear transformation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and define \[F(\mathcal{P})=\{F(v)\ |\ v\in\mathcal{P}\} \] Then $F(\mathcal{P})$ is also a parabola Proof Omitted Use the fact that a conic of the form \[ax^2+bxy+cy^2+dx+ey+f=0\] is a parabola if and only if $b^2 4ac=0$ 
 
 With this in mind scale the $y$ axis by $\tfrac5{12}$ This scaling preserves the trisection property of lines and furthermore preserves the tangency of $\mathcal{P}$ to the $x$ and $y$ axes and so the answer to the original question will be $\tfrac{12}5$ the answer to this new problem Furthermore rotate the entire diagram $45^\circ$ counterclockwise about the origin By the arctangent formula a line with slope $m$ in this frame has a slope of $\tfrac{1 m}{1+m}$ in the original frame so it's not hard to transform back and forth Let $\mathcal{P}'$ be the parabola which results from these transformations then $\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=x$ and $y= x$ and the directrix of $\mathcal{P'}$ is a line parallel to the line $y=0$ This in turn means that $y=cx^2+d$ for some constants $c$ and $d$ To deal with the fact that $\mathcal{P'}$ is tangent to the lines $y=\pm x$ note that this means the equations $y=cx^2 x+d$ and $y=cx^2+x+d$ each have exactly one root This means their discriminants are zero so $1^2 4cd = 0\implies d=\tfrac{1}{4c}$ In fact we can make $c$ arbitrary due to scaling so take $c=1$ This gives $d=\tfrac14$ so the equation of $\mathcal{P}'$ is now $y=x^2+\tfrac14$ 
 
 Consider any $\mathcal{P}'$ friendly segment with endpoints $( 3a 3a)$ and $(3b 3b)$ We want $( a+2b a+2b)$ and $( 2a+b 2a+b)$ to both be points on $\mathcal{P}'$ This gives the system of equations \[\begin{cases}a+2b&=( a+2b)^2+\frac14 \\2a+b&=( 2a+b)^2+\frac14 \end{cases}\] Subtracting the first equation from the second yields \[a b=( 2a+b)^2 ( a+2b)^2=(2a b)^2 (a 2b)^2=3(a+b)(a b) \] Hence either $a=b$ or $a+b=\tfrac13$ In the former case this segment is horizontal It's clear by the Intermediate Value Theorem (or an analogous argument) that there are precisely two such $\mathcal{P}'$ friendly segments contributing $2\cdot\tfrac{0 1}{0+1}= 2$ to the sum of the slopes of the lines On the other hand if $a+b=\tfrac13$ then let $m=\tfrac{b a}{b+a}=3(b a)=6b 1$ be the slope of the line in question We wish to find the sum of the values of \[\dfrac{m 1}{m+1}=\dfrac{6b 2}{6b}=1 \frac1{3b} \] i e the slopes of all lines after they have been rotated $45$ degrees Note that by plugging $a+b=\tfrac13$ into the first equation of the system we get the quadratic \[\frac13+b=\left( \frac13+3b\right)^2+\frac14 \] Expanding and simplifying yields that this quadratic is equivalent to \[9b^2 3b+\frac1{36}=0 \] so by Vieta's formulas if $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the two roots of the above quadratic then \[\left(1 \frac1{3b_1}\right)+\left(1 \frac1{3b_2}\right) = 2 \frac13\left(\dfrac{b_1+b_2}{b_1b_2}\right)=2 \frac13\left(\frac{3}{1/36}\right) = 2 \frac1{36} \] Therefore the sum of all the slopes of the lines for the original parabola $\mathcal{P}$ is \[\dfrac{12}5\left[ 2+\left(2 \frac1{36}\right)\right]= \frac{432}5\] and the requested answer is $432+5=\boxed{437}$",true,false,0,"Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the unique parabola in the $xy$-plane which is tangent to the $x$-axis at $(5,0)$ and to the $y$-axis at $(0,12)$.
